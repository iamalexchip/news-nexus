            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>A basic understanding of Kotlin and Node.js is needed to follow this tutorial.</blockquote><p>Just as the name implies, the aim of this article is to show the realtime movement of a marker on a map. This feature is common in location tracking applications. We see taxi apps and food ordering apps making use of features like this. Google provides an extremely easy map API, which we will take advantage of, while the realtime functionalities will be taken care of by¬†Pusher.</p><h3>What we will¬†build</h3><p>We will build an application that will receive coordinates from the server based on the initial coordinates we inject into it. When these coordinates are received, we update the map on our¬†app.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*V1Z-O_yCf5KrrXTGJBpaAw.gif" /></figure><h3>Requirements</h3><p>For this tutorial, we need the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/archive.html">Android studio</a>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääversion 3.0.1 or higher is recommended.</li><li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node JS</a> and npm installed on your¬†machine.</li><li>A <a href="https://dashboard.pusher.com">Pusher</a> application.</li><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup">Google Maps API¬†key</a>.</li><li>An Android device with Google Play Services installed.</li></ul><h3>Building our¬†server</h3><p>We will build our server using Node JS. The server will generate random coordinates for us. To start with, create a new folder. Inside it, create a new file named package.json and paste¬†this:</p><pre>{<br>    &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,<br>    &quot;dependencies&quot;: {<br>        &quot;body-parser&quot;: &quot;^1.16.0&quot;,<br>        &quot;express&quot;: &quot;^4.14.1&quot;,<br>        &quot;pusher&quot;: &quot;^1.5.1&quot;<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>Next, create file called index.js in the root directory and paste¬†this:</p><pre>// Load the required libraries<br>let Pusher = require(&#39;pusher&#39;);<br>let express = require(&#39;express&#39;);<br>let bodyParser = require(&#39;body-parser&#39;);</pre><pre>// initialize express and pusher<br>let app = express();<br>let pusher = new Pusher(require(&#39;./config.js&#39;));</pre><pre>// Middlewares<br>app.use(bodyParser.json());<br>app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));</pre><pre>// Generates 20 simulated GPS coords and sends to Pusher<br>app.post(&#39;/simulate&#39;, (req, res, next) =&gt; {<br>    let loopCount = 0<br>    let operator  = 0.001000  <br>    let longitude = parseFloat(req.body.longitude)<br>    let latitude  = parseFloat(req.body.latitude)<br>    <br>    let sendToPusher = setInterval(() =&gt; {<br>        loopCount++;</pre><pre>        // Calculate new coordinates and round to 6 decimal places...<br>        longitude = parseFloat((longitude + operator).toFixed(7))<br>        latitude  = parseFloat((latitude - operator).toFixed(7))</pre><pre>        // Send to pusher<br>        pusher.trigger(&#39;my-channel&#39;, &#39;new-values&#39;, {longitude, latitude})</pre><pre>        if (loopCount === 20) {<br>            clearInterval(sendToPusher)<br>        }<br>    }, 2000);</pre><pre>    res.json({success: 200})<br>})</pre><pre>// Index<br>app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&gt; res.json(&quot;It works!&quot;));</pre><pre>// Serve app<br>app.listen(4000, _ =&gt; console.log(&#39;App listening on port 4000!&#39;));</pre><p>The code above is an Express application. In the /simulate route, we are simulating longitude and latitude values and then sending them to Pusher. These will then be picked by our application.</p><blockquote><em>üí° The longitude and latitude values will typically be obtained from the device being tracked in a real-life scenario.</em></blockquote><p>Finally, we will create the configuration file, named config.js. Paste this snippet¬†there:</p><pre>module.exports = {<br>    appId: &#39;PUSHER_APP_ID&#39;,<br>    key: &#39;PUSHER_APP_KEY&#39;,<br>    secret: &#39;PUSHER_APP_SECRET&#39;,<br>    cluster: &#39;PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER&#39;,<br>};</pre><p>Replace the values there with the keys from your Pusher dashboard. Then install the modules needed by our server by running this command in the root directory:</p><pre>$ npm install</pre><p>Our server should be up and running on port¬†<strong>4000</strong>.</p><h3>Building our realtime map in Android¬†Studio</h3><h3>Create a new Android¬†project</h3><p>Open Android studio and create a new project. Enter your application details, include Kotlin support, choose a minimum SDK (this should not be less than API 14), choose an Empty Activity, and finish the process. Here is a quick GIF of the¬†process:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*50_QA8_AwbFF_fBmBq7j7Q.gif" /></figure><h3>Adding app dependencies</h3><p>This demo has several dependencies. We need the Pusher dependency for realtime functionality, the Google Maps API for easy integration of maps into our app, and Retrofit to access our server with¬†ease.</p><p>Open your app-module build.gradle file and paste the following dependencies:</p><pre>// Pusher dependency<br>implementation &#39;com.pusher:pusher-java-client:1.5.0&#39;</pre><pre>// Google maps API<br>implementation &#39;com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:11.8.0&#39;</pre><pre>// Retrofit dependencies<br>implementation &#39;com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0&#39;<br>implementation &#39;com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-scalars:2.3.0&#39;</pre><p>Sync your Gradle files so that the libraries can be downloaded and made available.</p><h3>Building our¬†layout</h3><p>Open the activity_main.xml and paste¬†this:</p><pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;FrameLayout xmlns:android=&quot;<a href="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android</a>&quot;<br>    xmlns:tools=&quot;<a href="http://schemas.android.com/tools">http://schemas.android.com/tools</a>&quot;<br>    android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br>    android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br>    android:orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;fragment xmlns:android=&quot;<a href="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android</a>&quot;<br>        xmlns:tools=&quot;<a href="http://schemas.android.com/tools">http://schemas.android.com/tools</a>&quot;<br>        android:layout_marginTop=&quot;50dp&quot;<br>        android:id=&quot;@+id/map&quot;<br>        android:name=&quot;com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment&quot;<br>        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br>        android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br>        tools:context=&quot;com.example.mapwithmarker.MapsMarkerActivity&quot; /&gt;<br>    &lt;Button<br>        android:id=&quot;@+id/simulateButton&quot;<br>        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br>        android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;<br>        android:text=&quot;Simulate&quot; /&gt;<br>&lt;/FrameLayout&gt;</pre><p>In the snippet above, we have a fragment which will hold our map and a¬†button.</p><h3>Setting up Google Maps API¬†key</h3><p>It is expected that at this point, you have obtained your API key. You can follow the steps <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup">here</a> to get it. We now want to configure the application with our key. Open your strings.xml file and paste it in. This is located at name-of-project/app/src/main/res/values:</p><pre>&lt;resources&gt;<br>    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;<br>    &lt;string name=&quot;google_maps_key&quot;&gt;GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY&lt;/string&gt;<br>&lt;/resources&gt;</pre><blockquote><em>‚ö†Ô∏è Replace the </em><em>GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY placeholder with the actual key from¬†Google.</em></blockquote><p>This file contains all strings used during the development of the application. All raw strings within the app are kept here. It is required when there is a need to translate your app into multiple languages.</p><p>Next, open the AndroidManifest.xml file and paste these under the &lt;application&gt; tag:</p><pre>&lt;meta-data<br>    android:name=&quot;com.google.android.gms.version&quot;<br>    android:value=&quot;<a href="http://twitter.com/integer/google_play_services_vers">@integer/google_play_services_vers</a>ion&quot; /&gt;<br>&lt;meta-data<br>    android:name=&quot;com.google.android.geo.API_KEY&quot;<br>    android:value=&quot;<a href="http://twitter.com/string/google_maps_key">@string/google_maps_key</a>&quot; /&gt;</pre><p>With this, our app knows how and where to fetch our¬†key.</p><h3>Setting up¬†Retrofit</h3><p>We already have Retrofit available as a dependency, but we need two more things‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan interface to show endpoints/routes to be accessed and our retrofit object. First create a new Kotlin file name ApiInterface.kt and paste¬†this:</p><pre>import okhttp3.RequestBody<br>import retrofit2.Call<br>import retrofit2.http.Body<br>import retrofit2.http.POST<br>interface ApiInterface {<br>    <a href="http://twitter.com/POST">@POST</a>(&quot;/simulate&quot;)<br>    fun sendCoordinates(<a href="http://twitter.com/Body">@Body</a> coordinates: RequestBody): Call&lt;String&gt;<br>}</pre><p>Since we will make just one request in this demo, we will limit the scope of our Retrofit object to the MainActivity.kt class. This means we will create a function within a class for it. Paste this function into the¬†class:</p><pre>fun getRetrofitObject(): ApiInterface {<br>    val httpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()<br>    val builder = Retrofit.Builder()<br>            .baseUrl(&quot;<a href="http://10.0.3.2:4000/">http://10.0.3.2:4000/</a>&quot;)<br>            .addConverterFactory(ScalarsConverterFactory.create())<br>    val retrofit = builder<br>            .client(httpClient.build())<br>            .build()<br>    return retrofit.create(ApiInterface::class.java)<br>}</pre><p>I used a Genymotion emulator and the recognized localhost address for it is 10.0.3.2.</p><p>Add the internet permission to the AndroidManifest.xml file:</p><pre>&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot;/&gt;</pre><h3>Configuring our map and getting realtime¬†updates</h3><p>For us to initialize and use the map, our the MainActivity.kt class must implement the OnMapReadyCallback interface and override the onMapReady method. We also need to setup Pusher to listen to events and receive the simulated coordinates in realtime. Open your MainActivity.kt and paste¬†this:</p><pre>import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity<br>import android.os.Bundle<br>import android.util.Log<br>import com.google.android.gms.maps.*<br>import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.MarkerOptions<br>import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng<br>import com.pusher.client.Pusher<br>import com.pusher.client.PusherOptions<br>import kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.activity_main.*<br>import okhttp3.MediaType<br>import okhttp3.OkHttpClient<br>import org.json.JSONObject<br>import retrofit2.Call<br>import retrofit2.Callback<br>import retrofit2.Response<br>import retrofit2.Retrofit<br>import retrofit2.converter.scalars.ScalarsConverterFactory<br>import okhttp3.RequestBody<br>import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.CameraPosition<br>import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.Marker</pre><pre>class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), OnMapReadyCallback {</pre><pre>    private lateinit var markerOptions:MarkerOptions</pre><pre>    private lateinit var marker:Marker</pre><pre>    private lateinit var cameraPosition:CameraPosition</pre><pre>    var defaultLongitude = -122.088426</pre><pre>    var defaultLatitude  = 37.388064</pre><pre>    lateinit var googleMap:GoogleMap</pre><pre>    lateinit var pusher:Pusher</pre><pre>    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {<br>        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)</pre><pre>        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)</pre><pre>        markerOptions = MarkerOptions()</pre><pre>        val latLng = LatLng(defaultLatitude,defaultLongitude)</pre><pre>        markerOptions.position(latLng)</pre><pre>        cameraPosition = CameraPosition.Builder()<br>                .target(latLng)<br>                .zoom(17f).build()<br>    }</pre><pre>    override fun onMapReady(googleMap: GoogleMap?) {<br>        this.googleMap = googleMap!!</pre><pre>        marker = googleMap.addMarker(markerOptions)<br>        googleMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPosition(cameraPosition))<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>We first created some class variables to hold our initial coordinates and other map utilities like the camera position and the marker position. We initialized them in the onCreate function. Next, we added a click listener to the simulate¬†button.</p><p>The next thing to do is still in the MainActivity.kt class. In the onCreate method, paste¬†this:</p><pre>simulateButton.setOnClickListener {<br>    callServerToSimulate()<br>}</pre><p>When the button is clicked, it calls the callServerToSimulate function. Create a function callServerToSimulate within the class like¬†this:</p><pre>private fun callServerToSimulate() {<br>    val jsonObject = JSONObject()<br>    jsonObject.put(&quot;latitude&quot;,defaultLatitude)<br>    jsonObject.put(&quot;longitude&quot;,defaultLongitude)<br>    val body = RequestBody.create(<br>        MediaType.parse(&quot;application/json&quot;), <br>        jsonObject.toString()<br>    )<br>    getRetrofitObject().sendCoordinates(body).enqueue(object:Callback&lt;String&gt;{<br>        override fun onResponse(call: Call&lt;String&gt;?, response: Response&lt;String&gt;?) {<br>            Log.d(&quot;TAG&quot;,response!!.body().toString())<br>        }<br>        override fun onFailure(call: Call&lt;String&gt;?, t: Throwable?) {<br>            Log.d(&quot;TAG&quot;,t!!.message)<br>        }<br>    })<br>}</pre><p>In this function, we sent our initial coordinates to our server. The server then generates twenty coordinates similar to the initial ones sent and uses Pusher to send them to channel my-channel, firing the new-values event.</p><p>Next, we create and initialize a SupportMapFragment object with the view ID of the¬†map:</p><pre>val mapFragment = supportFragmentManager.findFragmentById(R.id.map)  as  SupportMapFragment<br>mapFragment.getMapAsync(this)<br>setupPusher()</pre><p>Next add the the setupPusher function to the class and it should looks like¬†this:</p><pre>private fun setupPusher() {<br>    val options = PusherOptions()<br>    options.setCluster(PUSHER_CLUSTER)<br>    pusher = Pusher(PUSHER_API_KEY, options)</pre><pre>    val channel = pusher.subscribe(&quot;my-channel&quot;)</pre><pre>    channel.bind(&quot;new-values&quot;) { channelName, eventName, data -&gt;<br>        val jsonObject = JSONObject(data)<br>        val lat:Double = jsonObject.getString(&quot;latitude&quot;).toDouble()<br>        val lon:Double =  jsonObject.getString(&quot;longitude&quot;).toDouble()<br>        <br>        runOnUiThread {<br>            val newLatLng = LatLng(lat, lon)<br>            marker.position = newLatLng<br>            cameraPosition = CameraPosition.Builder()<br>                    .target(newLatLng)<br>                    .zoom(17f).build()<br>            googleMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPosition(cameraPosition))<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>We initialized Pusher here and listened for coordinate updates. When we receive any update, we update our marker and move the camera view towards the new point. You are expected to replace the Pusher parameters with the keys and details found on your Pusher dashboard.</p><p>We then call the disconnect and connect functions in the onPause and onResume functions respectively in the class. These functions are inherited from the parent class AppCompatActivity:</p><pre>override fun onResume() {<br>    super.onResume()<br>    pusher.connect()<br>}</pre><pre>override fun onPause() {<br>    super.onPause()<br>    pusher.disconnect()<br>}</pre><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>We have been able to leverage the power of Pusher, Kotlin and Google Maps API to create a realtime location tracking app. Hopefully you have picked up a thing or two from the tutorial and can use the knowledge to build beautiful realtime apps using Pusher and¬†Kotlin.</p><p>This post first appeared on the <a href="https://pusher.com/tutorials/realtime-map-kotlin">Pusher</a>¬†blog.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8f99ebd15fc" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/build-a-realtime-map-using-kotlin-8f99ebd15fc">Build a realtime map using Kotlin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ScYJutYYxPhr6mIjhGodBA.jpeg" /></figure><p>As someone who‚Äôs flirted with technology reporting for years, it was only a matter of time before I went from covering sterile ‚Äòdigital transformation!‚Äô events hosted by middle-aged Corporation Men in grey suits to wacky ‚Äòhackathons‚Äô hosted by a <a href="https://preview.ibb.co/cNyygJ/Travis.jpg">man with a white afro wearing a Pac-Man¬†suit</a>.</p><p>Yes, the world is changing. Fast. And I think, on the whole, I prefer this emerging one. The Generation Zers at the <a href="http://cmw.net/cmw-hackathon/">Canadian Music Week 2018 Hackathon</a><strong> </strong>were hungry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfull of purpose and the energy that comes from knowing that geeks are now certifiably cool and that you and your technological black magic are destined to inherit the¬†Earth.</p><p>No whiff of the sinister intentions of the men in grey suits, just a collection of people <a href="http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/12/watch-dogs-2-cast.jpg">resembling the cast of Watch Dogs 2</a> united in the belief that their coding can change the world. ‚ÄúEveryone wants to build something and make an impact,‚Äù said one attendee. ‚ÄúAnd music can change¬†lives.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make the music industry what it should be,‚Äù said a blockchain advocate sporting red-tinted glasses and a black duster. It reminded me of Taylor Pearson‚Äôs Ribbon Farm article <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/10/10/the-blockchain-man/">The Blockchain Man</a>, in which he outlines how such people will soon take over from the Organization Man. I appear to have witnessed the primordial soup of that shift of¬†power.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KSK_xqADvkSNQySVWdRSaQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>The Hackathon ran for 24 hours from the sunny Toronto afternoon of May 8 to the equally sunny afternoon of May 9 in a snack-filled basement office just off King Street. Experts in VR, AR, blockchain and AI were encouraged to attend, enticed with rare access to APIs from the likes of Universal Music Canada, which offered up its 15,000-track catalogue for the¬†event.</p><p>As the hacking got underway I made my way around the tables to see what the teams were up to. I was first drawn to a guy wearing an Igorrr tee who said he‚Äôd found a way to create fully-automated death metal music using machine learning and neural techniques.</p><p><a href="http://dadabots.com/nips2017/generating-black-metal-and-math-rock.pdf">He wasn‚Äôt kidding</a>. CJ Carr‚Äôs ‚Äòband‚Äô <a href="https://dadabots.bandcamp.com/">DADABOTS</a> has been around for a while, and he was at the Hackathon looking for help to make his AI-generated music more coherent. There‚Äôs something eerily dystopian and detached about the idea of an artificial intelligence making our music, but Carr was infectiously passionate about his project, and it was pretty¬†cool.</p><p>Toronto rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roller <a href="http://stateofsate.com/">SATE</a> was there looking for help to build an augmented reality experience for her concerts. She wanted to create an app that would do things like make digital flames come out of her head while she‚Äôs on¬†stage.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s8NJDGdFIasDulxVCjIQuQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>The team behind Music Moji used the Spotify API to build a machine learning tool that would help people find music they‚Äôre in the mood for based on the emojis they click. For example, click the sad face emoji and you‚Äôll perhaps be presented with the likes of Fallout¬†Boy.</p><p>Elsewhere, team Spotlight were building an app inspired by the live trivia game HQ and American Idol that would have users voting on live streams of independent artist performances. The idea is that more indie musicians will have the chance to make it big, and fans will have the satisfaction of knowing they played a part in making it¬†happen.</p><p>Something grumpy and cynical could be said here about the soul being stripped out of music, which you can‚Äôt help but feel when you‚Äôre being shown AI-generated death metal and emoji-based recommendations, but I think that would be missing the¬†point.</p><p>The ideas at the Hackathon might have seemed somewhat cold, but the collaboration and enthusiasm on show was nothing but warming. This was just a group of people doing what people have long done: come together to celebrate their love of music.

With the revolution of <strong>Blockchain</strong> it seems that we are headed towards a better, more complete and innovative future. Companies across all industries are pushing hard to be the ‚Äúearly bird that eats the worm‚Äù and achieving their legacy and create¬†history.</p><p>So why have we not yet gained the <strong>momentum</strong> we are all waiting for? Don‚Äôt you feel like we were supposed to move even faster with all this fund raising and innovative implementations? Can we truly compare this to the revolution of the internet? Masterminds are coming together, creating new projects and ways to adventure into the world of Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies &amp; Smart Contracts, so the real question is, how do we gain the true momentum of this technology and use it to better our lives and our¬†future.</p><h3>Same Technology; Different Race</h3><blockquote><strong>‚ÄúThe best way to predict </strong>your <strong>future is to create</strong> it.‚Äù Abraham¬†Lincoln</blockquote><p>The truth is, as humans we compete to always finish first and eventually find out that all the other participants are in a totally different race. It starts with innovation and the intention to improve the industry but surely turns to a competition on who finishes the fastest, and makes the biggest buzz. <strong><em>What if we told you we can change¬†that?</em></strong></p><p>What if it were possible to work together, hand in hand while sharing resources and knowledge? There are a few reasons why people are unable to partner up and work together:</p><ol><li><strong>Ego.</strong> People think it‚Äôs a weakness to cooperate or even think they are too good and can accomplish everything by themselves.</li><li><strong>Fear.</strong> Market participants are scared of companies and other ICOs they do not know a lot about. There is always the assumption that any ICO could be a scam and would affect you negatively.</li><li><strong>Competition</strong>, in which everyone solely focuses on themselves and any ICO trying to find an ally, believes there are many others that are doing better and can land better partnerships.</li></ol><h3><a href="http://www.INGOTCoin.io">INGOT Coin</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.TRADE.io">Trade.io</a> Assemble the A¬†Team</h3><blockquote><strong>‚ÄúC vs C‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI believe in Collaboration, I don‚Äôt believe in Competition.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>RideSharing is the economic powerhouse driving autonomous vehicles to take¬†flight.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5tBRMeW4ETfbBYUrrolzrw.png" /><figcaption>Lyft‚Äôs self driving car and Lilium¬†Jet</figcaption></figure><p>The RideSharing model changed everything we knew about mobility. Packed metro rides and graffiti covered busses transformed for many into hailing a cab. As the driver begins to become less important, and billions of dollars go into autonomous systems, the car itself is evolving. Many people today talk about how the end goal is self driving cars, but the technology will quickly surpass self driving and take¬†flight.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*B-23eyjP6rDNDa61." /><figcaption><a href="https://lilium.com/">Lulium Jet</a></figcaption></figure><p>I sat at the Launch of Ola Play in Bangalore, India. I was the only foreigner, half crazed and sleep deprived. Ola had just announced the first in-car computing platform custom designed for RideSharing. With only an hours sleep, I watched history unfold before¬†me.</p><p>‚ÄúTo date, to be very honest,‚Äù Amit Sagar, of Mahindra explained, ‚ÄúEvery single innovation has been focused towards the driver. But now the time has come to focus our attention on the passenger sitting in the rear¬†seat.‚Äù</p><p>For the first time in history, an automaker stated publicly that the passenger was becoming more important than the driver. The VP sales continued in Jobsian fashion, ‚ÄúWe are at an inflection point, and with this we will lead a new story going forward.‚Äù</p><p>Mahindra, one of India‚Äôs largest automakers, had just revealed that vehicle design is changing forever, with focus now shifting to the passenger. In countries like India, most of the population will never own a¬†car.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*pij82kr21DWGN-Qq." /><figcaption>DARPA Funded <a href="http://www.aurora.aero/">Aurora</a> has partnered with Uber¬†(Aurora)</figcaption></figure><p>In the past, flying cars were expensive dreams. It would be prohibitively expensive to have flying cars until a new economic model arose, RideSharing. The RideSharing model meant that one vehicle could have many trips, operating at near maximum efficiency. This means that the cost of the vehicle can be distributed across thousands of rides. RideSharing enabled mobility for people in India that could never afford a car. This same RideSharing model means that flying cars have just found a way to become affordable for the¬†masses.</p><p>In fact, Flying cars appear so lucrative, RideSharing companies like Uber and Lyft have been partnering publicly (and through the grapevine) on deploying Vertical Take Off and Landing vehicles (or VTOL, as the industry prefers).</p><p>Uber released a white-paper in 2016 with astounding numbers. A VTOL trip from San Francisco to San Jose will soon become competitive with a cab¬†ride.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JmJceua1kQZg0-EI." /><figcaption><a href="https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf">Uber Elevate</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even more interestingly, because much of the cost associated with operations are human, (maintenance, etc.) VTOL RideSharing will be economically feasible even in places like¬†India:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*f29NxsPr_QckZIZD." /><figcaption><a href="https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf">Uber Elevate</a></figcaption></figure><p>I have personally ridden in an Ola Cab from Gurgaon to Connaught Place in Delhi (after too much to drink in Cyber City). Rs 1000 (~$15 USD) for a flying car would become extremely popular.</p><p>Uber is planning tests in Dubai and Dallas, where they held their secretive, Invite only Elevate Conference.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*31dGF78M1v2Hxb9n." /><figcaption>Ehang at CES Las Vegas¬†(Author)</figcaption></figure><p>On the other side of the Earth in China, companies like Ehang are racing ahead on their own. At CES 2017 in Las Vegas, a representative told me that Ehang and Uber were ‚ÄúIn Conversation‚Äù. In my opinion there is no reason to¬†partner.</p><p>Whomever owns the autonomous VTOL infrastructure will benefit from its revenues. Handing that off to another company like Uber doesn‚Äôt make sense. This idea is validated by the fact that OEMs like Tesla, and Volkswagen have publicly stated their self driving cars will not be allowed on Uber. The RideSharing industry is slowly fragmenting as automakers build their own RideSharing Networks.</p><p>On the other hand, RideSharing companies like Uber, Lyft, Gett, and Waymo are actively developing their own Autonomous Technologies. Whomever owns the infrastructure, owns the revenues from an autonomous network. Uber and Lyft, by developing their own hardware, are actively preparing themselves for a future of¬†flight.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vnFsVUI-g6MjwrFY." /><figcaption><a href="https://lilium.com/">Lilium</a></figcaption></figure><p>As technologies surrounding autonomous systems, battery technology, and robotic flight are converging, dozens of companies are building flying cars. The technology exist right now in prototype and in the air. DARPA funded Aurora and German Lilium jet have become top contenders using electric ducted fan¬†motors.</p><p>Joby, Kitty hawk, and Zee.Aero are all coming out of Silicon Valley, building working prototypes (the latter two are funded directly by Google‚Äôs Larry Page.) Governments and Venture capitalists are pouring money into VTOL. While most VTOL startups are still in‚Äústealth‚Äù, according to Crunchbase, Lilium alone has raised over $101.4 Million USD. Massive funding in autonomous vehicle hardware and software is further lowering the cost of deploying VTOL infrastructure.</p><p>Computer vision software, and robotic hardware are converging so quickly that even the big, slow moving aerospace companies are getting involved. AirBus has spun off two projects, Pop.up and¬†Vahana.</p><p>Vahana, in ancient Sanskrit means ‚Äúone that carries‚Äù appearing in the Bhagavad Gita thousands of years ago. The ancients believed in flying cars, now investors do¬†too.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8BqzwqYBxObMP9m6." /><figcaption>AirBus Vahana</figcaption></figure><p>Money, technology, and demand exists right now to make flying cars economically feasible. What we are waiting for is legislation. Existing Ride Sharing companies already have a foot in rapidly developing countries‚Äô legal systems (RideSharing is still illegal in most places, but governments turn a blind eye.) Uber has even been accused of bribery.<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigates-whether-uber-violated-u-s-foreign-bribery-laws-1504040457"> (Wall Street Journal Via Engadget)</a></p><p>As more ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù countries await legislation around licensing autonomous flight, places like Dubai and China are pushing forward with live tests. It is not difficult to imagine that in the next 3 years, VTOL RideSharing will be very real in many¬†places.</p><h3>Unintended Consequences</h3><p>The consequences of autonomous flight will also be very real. Many claim that autonomous cars alone may drastically reduce property value in cities (<a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/5/16/15644358/parking-real-estate-driverless-cars-urban-planning-development">Curbed has done a great article on this</a>). Curbed explains that developers like AvalonBay in Los Angeles are already designing for an autonomous future. As self driving cars reduce the need for parking garages, AvalonBay is designing their garages to be converted into¬†housing.</p><p>While autonomous cars may help developers maximize urban space, VTOL could accelerate de-urbanization for those who can afford it. If VTOL can expand in cost and access faster than city populations can grow, property may begin to devalue as the ultra-rich move away from city center. Autonomous systems are going to fundamentally change the way our cities are designed.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*R2hboHXfCTrfc_Xv." /><figcaption>Lilium</figcaption></figure><p>Why would anyone live in the city, if they could bypass the chaos of traffic and live somewhere more affordable? Lilium estimated their VTOL jet will put much of Marin County (North of San Francisco) Into range of downtown.</p><p>It is not difficult to imagine climbing to the roof of your Marin County home, awaiting a VTOL to San Francisco. Your Apple watch pings, and a shining electric VTOL settles onto your solar landing pad. The electric Vahana or Lilium jet takes off and lands in SoMa ten minutes¬†later.</p><p>If Uber‚Äôs Elevate white paper is accurate, it may not only be more affordable, but faster to commute from somewhere like Marin, than to take a cab through Silicon Valley. VTOL could drastically enhance the value of land around our cities, and make center city ‚Äúuncool‚Äù to¬†live.</p><h3>Deurbanization</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*D1WMQgzQWWH3Rb4jCEEQzQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>VTOL Oasis¬†(Author)</figcaption></figure><p>In the 1920‚Äôs, when airplane ranges were still small, futurists imagined giant floating islands built at sea, facilitating ‚Äúhops‚Äù across the Atlantic. As the range of VTOL increases, we can begin to imagine flying VTOL instead of a commercial airline. A trip between Los Angeles and Las Vegas could be cut in half by VTOL ‚Äúoasis‚Äù hidden amongst the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RIsVsH2P9LDIqiG-peEOwQ.png" /></figure><p>We can begin to imagine these new cities arising in the middle of nowhere, strategically positioned between points of interest. The drive for humans to escape cities, and the affordability of VTOL just might replace the Jet¬†age.</p><p>As new RideSharing models quickly prove feasibility, investors and startups are racing for what lies beyond self driving cars. If legislation can keep pace with technology, our skies, and cities will quickly transform into something new. As technology continues to accelerate at the exponential pace in which we are experiencing, VTOL may quickly evolve into affordable access to outer¬†space.</p><p><strong><em>Garrett Kinsman</em></strong><em> Writes for Autonomous Tomorrow based out of Bangalore, India, and San Francisco.</em></p><h3>Resources:</h3><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F6PmXL0oiggg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6PmXL0oiggg&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F6PmXL0oiggg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/30f89dc798fc533a0adbff745ad3ad29/href">https://medium.com/media/30f89dc798fc533a0adbff745ad3ad29/href</a></iframe><p><a href="https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf">https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.aurora.aero/">Aurora Flight Sciences - Apply autonomy and robotics to the development, production, and operation of advanced aircraft.</a></li><li><a href="https://lilium.com/">Lilium</a></li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8983f1396e29" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/ridesharing-means-flying-cars-are-here-to-stay-8983f1396e29">RideSharing means Flying Cars are Here to Stay</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Personally, I have gotten a lot of insight from the people I will list here. Some of them may be people you already know while others will be new. <strong>The purpose is to be connected to credible people that you can trust their information</strong>. Most of them come out to clear misinformation in the crypto world especially when it pertains to the area they function. And you know how important information is in the world of¬†today.</p><blockquote>1. Joseph Young (username: iamjosephyoung)</blockquote><p>I came in contact with this guy when a simple tweet of his explained a situation that was already a source of panic. His insights are so precise and apt. <strong>His information can be trusted to a large extent</strong>. Also, he is honest, sincere and plain straightforward. I have never seen a useless tweet from him. In a world where top media giants produce misinformation, there is need to be connected to someone like¬†Joseph.</p><blockquote>2. Ari Paul (username: AriDavidPaul)</blockquote><p>He is the CIO of BlockTower Capital. <strong>He offers a simple approach to communicating sincere facts, sometimes with a bit of humor (or sarcasm)</strong>. He has a strong knowledge of the blockchain world and passes his information in a way that is easily comprehended. His insights are unique and they are worth reading every¬†time.</p><blockquote>3. CZ (username: cz_binance)</blockquote><p>This is the CEO of Binance. Binance is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform (now) headquartered in Malta. <strong>Apart from using his account to laud important information from Binance, CZ also gives occasional insight about developments in the real world concerning the blockchain ecosystem</strong>. He is growing so fast as a global leader in the cryptocurrency space. If you have a Binance account, you ought to be connected to¬†him.</p><blockquote>4. Kyle Samani (username: KyleSamani)</blockquote><blockquote>5. Tushar Jain (username: TusharJain_)</blockquote><p>This duo are the managing partners of Multicoin Capital. <strong>They take you deep in insight and analysis of the crypto market and ecosystem</strong>. If you want to go down deep into fundamental economic analysis or you desire a technical breakdown of any fundamentals, these are your friends. These are the guys you don‚Äôt speed-read what they write. If you are not so vast in the crypto world, you can get lost easily. But if you are patient and willing to understand deep, you will find their thoughts and arguments very enlightening.</p><blockquote>6. Luke Martin (username: VentureCoinist)</blockquote><p>For people who love charts and technical analysis, this is someone to get connected with. <strong>He unveils various insights based on charts to make decisions</strong>. His technical analysis is not meant as a financial instruction or advice. You follow his analysis at your own risk. But you will find it interesting to see how he thinks and how he interprets the trends and patterns on a¬†chart.</p><blockquote>7. Samson Mow (username: Excellion)</blockquote><p>This is the CSO of Blockstream. A very popular figure in the world of bitcoin. <strong>He is a source of reliable information</strong>. Playful at times. He is well-meaning in his expressions, very sound in fundamentals and a promoter of global adoption for bitcoin. He is someone to stay in touch¬†with.</p><blockquote>8. Francis Pouliot (username: francispouliot_)</blockquote><p>Here is someone that is so into growth and development in the crypto space. If you are keen on keeping tabs with structural development in the world of cryptocurrency, this is someone you would love. <strong>He is also a strong advocate for bitcoin adoption especially by traditional and institutional investors</strong>.</p><blockquote>9. BTF%$D! (username: CryptoHustle)</blockquote><p>For me, this is the source of humor on the list. He often gives insight and analysis of the market, but I don‚Äôt take him serious. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean he is always wrong. <strong>He often posts pictures, videos that apply to the current state in the crypto market that would make you laugh (or at least smile)</strong>. His tweets are often intended as jokes also. If you are quickly offended, you may not like¬†him.</p><blockquote>10. Ran NeuNer (username: Cryptomanran)</blockquote><p>This is the host of the TV show, Crypto Trader on CNBC. He is a great source of news and information. His show does interviews with many of the big names in Crypto. He also covers big events in the crypto world. <strong>His show is very enlightening and educative. His tweets are also like that</strong>. You get links from him to watch the latest episode of his show on YouTube. He asks good questions and you can tell he kind of likes his¬†job.</p><p>Some may be wondering why I have not included very big names like the founders of Litecoin and Ethereum, etc. The purpose of this is to get you connected to people you probably do not know and can get a wealth of information and value from. There are other sound people in the crypto space with excellent minds. <strong>You‚Äôll get to meet more of them through the RTs of those on this list</strong>. However, don‚Äôt follow blindly. Verify the account and see if the tweet content of the account is something you want to be seeing on your timeline. If you have other insightful people you know, you can post in the comments.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me start with an ‚Äúad hominem‚Äù argument first (it is not really one): Daniel is the founder of a blockchain startup, so obviously very vested and interested in the success of the blockchain hype. Failure of the blockchain hype would mean business failure for¬†him.</p><p>This means that he is serious about this arguments, so that makes it interesting to reflect on¬†them.</p><p>The argument that blockchain gets rid of middlemen is funny. If there are no middlemen, who are the miners? Who are the other actors building trust in the system? Or providing hardware wallets for people to store their tokens on? Just because you might rid of the current middlemen does not mean that you are not replacing them by new ones, which are not necessarily better.</p><p>However, the new ones are less regulated and more implicit than the ones we currently have. Does that create more transparency? Not really, and it dilutes accountability much more than before. You better not get scammed out of your BitCoins because there won‚Äôt be a good legal framework to help you at the¬†moment.</p><p>Also: ‚ÄúBlockchain is the first decentralized network for any kinds of value transfer‚Äù does not really mean anything. In loose terms, SWIFT was first, and SWIFT was not centralized either and can actually execute quite a few more transactions per second than BitCoin. This brings us to the next argument.</p><p>Blockchain itself does not reduce transaction costs for people. Except if you are into money laundering. Then, it is really great and allows you to keep more of the¬†cut.</p><p>Implicit trust in institutions is always going to be cheaper than explicit trust generated by mining and data distribution. Just because you capitalize mathematics doesn‚Äôt make the statement true.</p><p>Have a look at <a href="https://transferwise.com">TransferWise</a> if you want to have a solution that is good at reducing transaction costs for money transfers. They don‚Äôt need blockchain for what they do. No one needs blockchain for what you are saying it is required¬†for.</p><p>Regarding Big Tech companies: the major players don‚Äôt define the rules of the game. They at most operate too freely when there is a vacuum. Regulators still define the¬†rules.</p><p>We are currently in a world where governments and lobbyists try to shift responsibility onto companies because they don‚Äôt have solutions yet themselves: for example, when implementing the right to be forgotten. That is not what should happen,¬†though.</p><p>Obviously, tech companies have responsibility for any data scandal, but we also have a responsibility to improve the laws to protect ourselves better in the¬†future.</p><p>So, how exactly is blockchain better for your data? You won‚Äôt really control who has copies of your data anymore. With BitCoin, all the miners need a¬†copy.</p><p>With decentralized systems, many other participants will need to store parts or all of your data. This is not better for your data. It makes it much harder to control where your data actually ends¬†up.</p><p>The internet started out as fully decentralized system with algorithmic routing of data, but that got quickly superseded by manual routing tables on the highest level because there were concrete political concerns about automated routing of, for example, US data through China or Russia. You will not get rid of this with algorithms.</p><p>Saying that there is an algorithmic solution that is simpler than the real world is denying the complexities of the real¬†world.</p><p>(Moreover, ‚Äúinternet networks‚Äù is not a real term by the way. It‚Äôs marginally better than calling it ‚Äúinternet tubes‚Äù, but not¬†much.)</p><p>You don‚Äôt need the blockchain to keep your data private. Messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal and Wire implement end-to-end encryption successfully without blockchain.</p><p>My original article has dug into the issues that would originate from decentralized versions of Google, YouTube and Facebook in depth. Saying that there would be no such entities because everything would be decentralized is exactly the¬†problem.</p><p>If we end up with a ‚Äúblockchain-based‚Äù decentralized version of all these platforms and no company being accountable for any that, who is accountable and liable and can be pressed for changes? If regulation is already difficult, how much more difficult would it become? Daniel has been avoiding those points in his response.</p><p>Also, even if I repeat myself, one of the great things we can learn from the ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù is that you always have emerging centralization and consolidation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven when you start out with a decentralized system.</p><p>Mining pools have become very centralized, as have ownership and control over the source code. Again, have a look at <a href="https://arewedecentralizedyet.com">https://arewedecentralizedyet.com</a>.</p><p>Why should we spend so many resources trying to setup decentralized systems and their rules to just end up with something centralized again?</p><p>Whatever the next big thing will be, it will not be ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù as people understand it¬†now.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f4f5147b0e36" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-response-to-daniel-tung-on-blockchain-is-the-ultimate-april-fools-joke-f4f5147b0e36">A response to Daniel Tung on &quot;Blockchain is the ultimate April Fool&#39;s joke&quot;</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/738/1*0zZ09keEm0AKHSHargUeVQ.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to build a basic chat bot for Telegram using Nest.js. This will, amongst other things, give you an overview of how Telegram bots works and what you can do with¬†them.</p><p>Telegram bot are simply accounts that do not require an additional phone number to setup. Users can interact with them via commands: opening a chat directly or sending a request directly from a chat input field by typing bot‚Äôs @username.</p><h3>What we‚Äôll be¬†building</h3><p>We‚Äôll be building a telegram bot with a username new-nest-bot, you can choose your own preferred name when registering a new telegram¬†bot.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBQaX3eVsdk&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBQaX3eVsdk&amp;</a></p><p>This bot was built to respond to text messages sent directly to it with predefined responses from the logic implemented on the back-end of the application.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>A basic understanding of TypeScript and Node.js will help you get the best out of this tutorial. I assume that you already have Node and npm installed, if otherwise quickly check <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> for further instructions and installation steps.</p><p>In addition, a Telegram account is also required to have access to Telegram services, either to start a chat or create a bot. If you don‚Äôt have an account, I recommend using the <a href="https://web.telegram.org/#/login">Telegram web¬†client</a></p><p>Finally, here is a quick overview of the technologies that we will be using in this¬†post.</p><ul><li><a href="https://nestjs.com/">Nest.js</a>:<strong> </strong>a progressive framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications; built to take the advantage of modern JavaScript but still preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*8_uUnP2g8H8Zj3N_KktFtw.png" /></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api">Node-telegram-bot-api</a>: a Node.js module to interact with the official <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Telegram Bot¬†API</a>.</li></ul><h3>Setting up the¬†project</h3><p>First, you need to install the <a href="https://nestjs.com/">Nest.js</a> starter project on <a href="https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter">Github</a> using Git. To do this, let‚Äôs run a command that will clone the starter repository into a new project folder named nest-telegram-chat-bot on your machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the command¬†below:</p><pre>$ git clone https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter.git nest-telegram-chat-bot</pre><p>Go ahead and change directory into the newly created folder and install all the dependencies for the¬†project.</p><pre>// change directory<br>cd nest-telegram-chat-bot<br></pre><pre>// install dependencies<br>npm install </pre><h3>Installing server dependencies</h3><p>The only server dependency required for this application is the <a href="https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api">node-telegram-bot-api</a>. Run the command below to install¬†it:</p><pre>$ npm install --save node-telegram-bot-api</pre><h3>Creating a Telegram¬†bot</h3><p>We‚Äôll basically be interacting with Telegram bot API. To do this, you will need to obtain an access token. Open a <a href="https://web.telegram.org/">Telegram app</a>, search for @BotFather and start the chat. Use the /newbot command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you a couple of questions, like the name and username, before an access token can be generated.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/695/0*uA1JKceuZv7b0l5_.png" /></figure><p>Follow all the instructions and once you are done, a token that is required to send requests to Telegram Bot API will be generated for you. As shown¬†below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BPP_fA5Qb1_SPRktYuuwWw.jpeg" /></figure><p>Now we have successfully created a bot, but it is passive at the moment as it has not been configured to respond to¬†chat.</p><h3>Making request</h3><p>Open a new tab in your browser and test the new bot by making a HTTPS request to the Telegram Bot API using this¬†URL:</p><pre>https://api.telegram.org/bot&lt;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;/getMe</pre><p>This will return a response in JSON format with the id, name and username of the¬†bot.</p><pre>{&quot;ok&quot;:true,&quot;result&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:591836832,&quot;is_bot&quot;:true,&quot;first_name&quot;:&quot;new-nest-bot&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;nest_demo_bot&quot;}}</pre><h3>Initialize the application controller</h3><p>When a user interacts with our bot on Telegram, the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Telegram Bot API</a> sends details about the interaction to our Nest.js application over a HTTP request and a response will be sent back with instructions on how the bot should respond. Let‚Äôs configure our application logic.</p><p>Nest.js starter project comes installed with a default controller named app.controller.ts. Open this file and update it with the code¬†below:</p><pre>// ./src/app.controller.ts</pre><pre><strong>import </strong>{ BotService } from &#39;./bot/bot.service&#39;;<br><strong>import </strong>{ Get, Controller, Res, HttpStatus } from &#39;@nestjs/common&#39;;<br><br>@Controller()<br><strong>export class </strong>AppController {<br>  constructor(<strong>private </strong>botService:BotService) {}<br><br>  @Get()<br>  getBotDialog(@Res() res) {<br>    <strong>this</strong>.botService.botMessage();<br>    res.status(HttpStatus.OK).send(&quot;Bot service started&quot;);<br>  }<br>}</pre><p>Once we start our application, this controller handles the incoming request and returns the appropriate response. As shown above, we imported BotService and injected it into the controller through the constructor. This is to ensure that app.controller.ts handles only the HTTP requests and abstracts the complex logic to a service. We‚Äôll set this up in the next¬†section</p><h3>Configure the bot¬†service</h3><p>Our AppController depends on a service named BotService to respond to the interaction with our Telegram bot, based on a specified logic. Let‚Äôs create this service. Create a bot folder within the src and proceed to create a new file named bot.service.ts within it. Next, open the newly created file and paste the code below into¬†it:</p><pre>// ./src/bot/bot.service.ts</pre><pre><strong>import </strong>{ Component} <strong>from </strong>&#39;@nestjs/common&#39;;<br><br>@Component()<br><strong>export class </strong>BotService {<br><br>    botMessage() {        <br>        process.env.NTBA_FIX_319 = &quot;1&quot;;<br>        <strong>const </strong>TelegramBot = require(&#39;node-telegram-bot-api&#39;);<br>        <br>        <strong>const </strong>token = &#39;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;;<br>        <br>        <strong>const </strong>bot = <strong>new </strong>TelegramBot(token, { polling: <strong>true </strong>});<br>    <br>        bot.on(&#39;message&#39;, (msg) =&gt; {<br>            <strong>let </strong>Hi = &quot;hi&quot;;<br>            <strong>if </strong>(msg.text.toString().toLowerCase().indexOf(Hi) === 0) {<br>                bot.sendMessage(msg.from.id, &quot;Hello &quot; + msg.from.first_name + &quot; what would you like to know about me ?&quot;);<br>            }<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>Here, we created a method named botMessage() and within it, we required the node-telegram-bot-api module and then assigned the access_token received from BotFather to a token variable. This token was later used as an argument to create a new TelegramBot(). Notice the second argument passed to the new TelegramBot()? What we have done here is to create our bot with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling">long polling</a> configuration by setting it to¬†true.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that, you can actually interact with a server in two¬†ways:</p><ol><li><a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/">Webhook</a>: A dedicated URL or can also be referred to as a web callback.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling">Long Polling</a>: This allows us to run our application locally without the need for a dedicated server or external¬†address.</li></ol><h3>Register the component</h3><p>At the moment, our application doesn‚Äôt recognize the newly created service.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Passive and semi-passive ways to earn income from¬†crypto</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/450/1*g7japL8pVuSc7mACnlly2g.gif" /></figure><p>When people think of making money from cryptocurrencies, they typically imagine someone manically day-trading or constantly buying into new ICOs. However, there are many other ways to earn income from cryptocurrencies that are not as active and do not require as much time. These methods range from semi-passive, which require a small amount of time, to fully passive, which require no time at all. Depending on your available capital and willingness to sign up for things, certain methods may be better suited to your current investment capability and/or personal preferences.</p><h3>Passive methods:</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*RFLGqF3OYiuZw21mrPtl6A.jpeg" /></figure><h4>Staking</h4><p>Blockchains that use proof-of-stake (PoS) variants allow you to earn additional coins by staking your coins. In exchange for helping secure the network and locking up your capital, you receive a proportional amount of the coin‚Äôs inflation. There are many PoS coins that each differ in their implementation and rewards‚Ää‚Äî<a href="https://www.reliablecoin.com/proof-of-stake-coins-list/">‚Ääthis site</a> provides a long list of all of them and links to their respective specifics. A specific type of PoS is delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), in which people vote for delegates, rather than directly staking as individuals. Staking rewards tend to be a bit higher in DPoS coins such as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ark/">Ark</a> and¬†<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lisk/">Lisk</a>.</p><p>The amount of initial setup ranges between coins; some require you to set up a consistently-online node, whereas others, such as Ark, require only a one-time setup through a wallet. Node staking is often more lucrative than simpler methods, at the expense of being more time-consuming and requiring a larger amount to stake. Assuming you want a more passive method, Ark‚Äôs staking can provide ~10% return with virtually no setup besides owning coins and choosing a delegate.</p><h4>Exchange coins</h4><p>Several exchanges such as <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=JtMrew">Kucoin</a> and <a href="http://coss.io">COSS</a> have tokens that allow you to receive a share of the fees collected by the exchange. Typically, a certain percent of the exchange‚Äôs collected fees are given back to token holders, and then within that portion, your received dividends are proportional to the amount of tokens you hold. This method is not necessarily very consistent, as it depends on exchange volume during a given period of time. However, if you are able to buy an exchange‚Äôs coin <em>before </em>it gains a lot of volume, you can end up earning a very high rate of return due to the token price initially being low. Note that this works in the opposite direction as well; if an exchange‚Äôs volume decreases, you may lose money in terms of both token price and dividends. Also note that these dividends may come in the form of coins on the exchange rather than in the exchange coin. This means that if you only hold a small amount of the exchange coin, you may receive amounts of each individual coin on the exchange that are too small to actually¬†sell.</p><h4>Dividend coins</h4><p>Some coins offer dividends in the form of other coins simply for holding the original coin. For example, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/">NEO</a> generates <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gas/">Gas</a>, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vechain/">Vechain</a> will generate THOR. Typically, each unit of the original coin will generate some predetermined amount of the new coin. These new coins are related to paying network fees, whereas the original coins can be thought of more as equity in the network. The rate of return on these methods is quite low (~3% for NEO‚Äôs Gas), but they require no work beyond owning the original coin, so it is a very passive, low-risk method of earning¬†income.</p><h3>Semi-passive methods:</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*LDFO6azwG2BpbBb0EPQajg.gif" /></figure><h4>Airdrops</h4><p>Airdrops are the crypto analog to free samples in the mall. Projects that are just starting out will oftentimes give out a small amount of free tokens to verified people in order to spread the word about their project. Typically, new projects will provide free tokens upon community involvement or signing-up and providing some basic personal information. Usually the amount given out during airdrops is small in terms of fiat currency, but if you hold on to the tokens for an extended period of time and you picked a good project, these tokens can grow in value, making your airdropped amount worth a significant amount of money. Also, airdrops are usually very quick to qualify for, so it is easy to do multiple airdrops in a short amount of time. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/airdrops-get-free-crypto-coins-from-top-icos-f729acdc67f3">For more information, and an ongoing airdrop, check out an earlier article I wrote on this¬†topic.</a></p><h4>Earn.com</h4><p><a href="https://earn.com/devinsoni/referral/?a=boy403lj06r3p066">Earn‚Äôs platform</a> is a very simple way to monetize your attention. After <a href="http://earn.com/devinsoni/referral/?a=boy403lj06r3p066">signing up to their platform</a> (you will need a company or school email), you will have a profile on their website. You will then be paid to receive and respond to messages and other tasks sent to you by other people on the platform. Currently, payments are provided in the form of Bitcoin. The specific payment amount is up to you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut typically this should scale with how ‚Äúimportant‚Äù of a person you are. Beyond this, Earn also has lists that you can register to, allowing you to receive messages from people targeting a specific demographic or group of people. For example, there are lists that aggregate people from certain universities or professions. There is also a well-known list for airdrop recipients, allowing users to be paid to receive free tokens from developing projects.</p><h4>Referrals</h4><p>Many websites, such as popular exchanges like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a241be35d022f0121b103c8">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=15025598">Binance</a>, offer referral programs that pay you to draw new customers to their exchanges. For your average person, this method is probably not going to net you much income. However, if you have a large audience through something like a popular blog or YouTube channel, referral links can be quite lucrative. These referral programs typically pay in coins listed on the exchange. Coinbase‚Äôs pays a static amount of Bitcoin, whereas Binance‚Äôs gives you a certain percent of the exchange fees collected from your referred people, in the form that it was collected in (either the coin itself, or¬†BNB).</p><p>Make sure you give this post <strong>50 claps </strong>and <a href="https://medium.com/@devins"><strong>follow me</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you enjoyed this post and want to see¬†more!</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@devins">Devin Soni - Medium</a></p><p>You can also follow me on<strong>¬†</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/devin_soni"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>!</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/devin_soni">Devin Soni (@devin_soni) | Twitter</a></p><figure><a href="https://goo.gl/w4Pbea"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*PZjwR1Nbluff5IMI6Y1T6g@2x.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4f4f2ac214c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-passive-income-from-crypto-4f4f2ac214c">How to Make Passive Income from Crypto</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Up in the¬†sky!</em></p><p><em>It‚Äôs a bird. It‚Äôs a plane. It‚Äôs Superman!</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sUONLloiU3fMza6qfaDdFw.jpeg" /></figure><p>In this famous preamble to the original TV show, it was clear that average citizens didn‚Äôt know what to make of a costumed man flying through the sky to fight crime. Superman, of course, was able to do pretty much anything in his constant battle for ‚Äútruth, justice, and the American¬†way‚Äù.</p><p>Amusingly, if one listens to all the rhetoric surrounding crypto, one hears a similar refrain. Claims of how blockchain projects will revolutionize every industry, put the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù out of business, democratize investing, and, of course, make people wealthy, seem to battle each other for hyperbole‚Ä¶</p><p>While this comparison is amusing, there <strong><em>are</em></strong> a couple of striking similarities: First, blockchain technology <strong><em>will</em></strong> almost certainly be very disruptive to a variety of industries both with improved efficiency and democratized access. Second, people <strong><em>do</em></strong> have a hard time categorizing crypto-assets, hence the ‚Äúbird, plane or Superman‚Äù reference in the title. In fact, a prime reason explaining crypto‚Äôs disruptive potential is that crypto assets are effectively polymorphic, meaning that different people will view the same asset as different things, depending on their unique perspective. When one is purchasing a crypto-asset on a market, they are an investment, when they operate inside of a network, they are more like a commodity, but when they are used to purchase goods or services outside of their native network, they are more like a currency.</p><p>Unfortunately, the flexibility provided by crypto-assets is a double-edged sword, as it creates a serious problem for regulators. This is because current regulations for investments (securities) hedging/speculative vehicles (futures/derivatives), tangible assets (commodities), payment mechanisms (currencies) and wealth storage (banking), overlap and often <strong><em>conflict</em></strong> with one another, making compliance with all of them difficult or impossible. In this regard, the flexibility and disruptive potential of crypto becomes its Achilles heel in the U.S., where regulation is an <strong><em>existential</em></strong> threat to many of the assets and the businesses reliant upon them. This should surprise no one, since this technology was totally inconceivable by the authors of the regulation which are in force today. As a result, we should all acknowledge that crypto-asset regulation requires a new approach.</p><p>Thankfully, if he meant it literally, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-clayton-2018-04-10">SEC chair Clayton provided guidance for the way forward in his latest speech</a>. His call for a principle-based approach, so as to NOT stop innovation is particularly heartening:</p><p>‚Äú<em>One of our key responsibilities as regulators is to strive to ensure that, as technology changes, our regulations continue to drive efficiency, integrity and resilience.</em>‚Äù</p><p>In practice, this would mean a compromise solution between <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-firms-investors-seek-exemption-from-sec-oversight-1524130200">self-interested calls from crypto-industry heavyweights for very lenient self-regulation</a>, and full-blown adherence to the existing (conflicting) web of securities, derivatives, banking and commodities laws. As I have described in previous posts, new regulations should be adopted to streamline and sharpen disclosures for crypto-asset issuers and rules for secondary trading of those assets should be principles-based. In the meantime, however, there are some practical steps that regulators can take to move the market towards the outcomes they¬†desire.</p><p>The most important step would be for the SEC to allow regulated broker dealers &amp; ATSs to trade existing crypto-assets and treat that activity similarly to how OTC securities are traded. At the same time, they should provide a time-period for firms and ‚Äúexchanges‚Äù that currently trade such assets, to become regulated entities. This could take the form of ‚Äúno action‚Äù relief to broker dealers or ATS‚Äôs that want to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other crypto assets. Such an action could be limited to those assets already trading on various non-regulated ‚Äúexchanges‚Äù or a subset which meet certain minimum thresholds.</p><p>Considering that these assets are already trading, with widespread U.S. investor participation, but without the benefit of foundational regulatory principles, this would be extremely beneficial to crypto investors. Such critical ideas as best execution, fair &amp; orderly markets, manipulation surveillance &amp; disclosure/management of conflicts of interest are important and the SEC should act to ensure they become the norm, rather than the exception in the crypto market. Since all brokers and Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs) are held to these principles by the regulators, regardless of detailed asset-specific rules, the transition to becoming such entities would help protect investors. These principles have worked to make markets better and protect investors, issuers and traders for many years, and there is no reason to think that they would have a different result in the crypto-markets. Specifically, lets consider each of these principals:</p><p><strong>Best Execution</strong>: Generally, best execution means that clients have a reasonable expectation that their agents, whether a retail broker, institutional agent or exchange will get them the best possible price within the parameters of their order. At CoinRoutes, we are focused on helping our clients achieve best execution via pan-exchange routing and algorithmic strategies and understand that best execution is not always simple to prove. Market conditions and the circumstances of each order need to be considered, but there are some clear guidelines that should be followed (and I will leave it to the readers to decide if they are being followed by current crypto-market participants):</p><ul><li>All available prices should be considered. It is ok to trade on specific venues if they are faster, more certain or trustworthy, but ignoring other markets completely without reason is extremely hard to¬†justify.</li><li>Clients should not take a back seat to a firm‚Äôs own positions; If a trader is holding a client order that is executable at a price, it is not acceptable for that trader to trade their own principal positions in front of such¬†orders.</li><li>No undisclosed mark-ups of price should be allowed. It is fine to charge a disclosed commission or fee, but the price received by the client should be what was transacted on their¬†behalf.</li></ul><p><strong>Fair and Orderly Markets</strong>: This idea, which is also called ‚Äújust and equitable principles of trade‚Äù are used by regulators to incentivize behaviors and structures that promote the integrity of the market. Ideally, competitive forces and innovations from companies such as CoinRoutes will do most of the work, but sometimes the incumbent players are resistant. As a result, the regulators can help by enforcing these key principles:</p><p>Fair access to markets, to ensure that no participants have undisclosed advantages in either speed of access to exchange data or matching engines or in the quality, use or amount of available market data. This should extend to the creation of execution or valuation benchmarks, where ‚Äúside deals‚Äù between established players that restrict the ability of participants to have a full understanding of the market should be actively discouraged.</p><p>Orderly markets, meaning that venues should take steps to protect against ‚Äúflash events‚Äù and erroneous trading which often cause uninformed investors to lose money. Such steps can take the form¬†of:</p><ul><li>Market access rules to prevent ‚Äúfat finger‚Äù errors that create erroneous orders</li><li>Rules to prevent firms from violating credit or exposure¬†limits</li><li>Policies to prevent markets moving too fast in an extremely short period of time, particularly when a SINGLE market moves out of sync with¬†others</li><li>Policies to prevent so-called ‚Äúmomentum ignition‚Äù strategies</li></ul><p><strong>Manipulation</strong>: Practices such as spoofing &amp; layering on exchange books can distort price discovery and lower investor confidence. Wash trading that distorts reported volumes can create the appearance of demand for assets and trigger algorithms to be more aggressive. As a result, it is imperative for an SRO to have a clear policy that will surveil against such practices and encourage exchanges and brokers to have policies and procedures to do so as¬†well.</p><p><strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong>: We believe that the potential for significant conflicts of interest must be addressed by an SRO. To do so, there must be clear delineation &amp; disclosure of the roles of Fund Manager, Retail Broker, Exchange, Principal Trading Desk, or Agency Broker as well as appropriate information barriers in place between them. To explain why, consider the following potential conflicts:</p><ul><li>Retail brokers, who have responsibilities to their end client, have a conflict of interest, if their firm makes additional profit when directing trading to their own venue, instead of competing venues with superior¬†prices.</li><li>Fund managers, who profit on their own trading venue when they rebalance their fund holdings, have a conflict of interest if their affiliated venue makes additional profit from the trades that result from those rebalances.</li><li>Principal Trading Desks, who would be more profitable if they have access to Exchange data such as client holdings or identities related to orders, since that information could be used to harm the clients of their affiliated exchange.</li><li>Agent or Principal Trading Desks who gain advantages, if they are provided faster data, market access or higher granularity of information by affiliated exchanges or trading¬†desks.</li></ul><p>These principles, which are all based on common sense, would improve the quality of the markets. If the SEC allowed current regulated entities to compete with unregulated ones in the trading of crypto assets, that would act to let the market push in that direction. ‚ÄúEncouraging‚Äù all the current exchanges to become regulated would also be helpful, as long as they did not force them to adhere to the full gamut of equity rules, some of which don‚Äôt apply and risk stopping innovation in the U.S. The principles-based approach suggested here, however, would provide significant benefit to investors while speeding up the maturation of the markets. If, at the same time, the SEC allowed a transition period to existing participants, to minimize disruption to existing investors, that would be a prudent approach.</p><p>Finally, I want to be clear that I wholeheartedly agree with the notion of forming a crypto SRO, as long as it includes these core principals within its mandate. It is also clear that there is a need for new crypto-asset specific regulations, but that will take time to implement and should be done in concert with the industry. That is why it is so important to take the simple steps I have suggested here. In addition to helping reform the markets, the clarity provided by such a direction would help overcome a <a href="http://blocktribune.com/sec-probe-cryptocurrencies-welcomed-worry-regulation/">potential ‚Äúchilling effect‚Äù on innovation in the US</a> with regard to crypto¬†assets.</p><figure><a href="https://goo.gl/w4Pbea"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*PZjwR1Nbluff5IMI6Y1T6g@2x.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac169fd5d342" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/its-a-bird-it-s-a-plane-no-it-s-bitcoin-ac169fd5d342">It‚Äôs a Bird, It‚Äôs a Plane, No it‚Äôs BITCOIN!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
