<p>ODDO BHF is an independent Franco-German financial services group, with branches worldwide and a history stretching back over 150 years. ODDO BHF will serve as a correspondent agent of NMB for US dollars and Euros.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correspondent-bank.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A correspondent bank</a> is a financial institution that provides services on behalf of another and as a result, this enables it to facilitate wire transfers, conduct business transactions, accept deposits and gather documents on behalf of another financial institution. So, NMB customers who are having trouble to do international transactions are happy to hear about this latest development.</p>
<p>On announcing their move, NMBZ Holdings chief executive officer Benefit Washaya said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are pleased to inform you that NMB Bank has now secured a correspondent agent for USD and EURO clearing with a German Bank, ODDO BHF.</p></blockquote>
<p>The partnership comes at a time when many banks are struggling to process foreign payments, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/12/finally-chinamasa-speaks-truth-causes-cash-crisis-parallel-exchange-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to the depleting </a>nostros. This has seen companies failing to pay for imported raw materials, thereby threatening industries.</p>
<p>RBZ has introduced a number of controls to manage the depleting Nostro accounts. The controls have seen many banks<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/10/which-bank-cards-are-working-to-make-online-payments-in-zimbabwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> scrapping the use of Visa and MasterCard debit cards for local transactions.</a></p>
<p>NMBZ Holdings says that both individual and corporate customers will be able to make international payments under this new arrangement.</p>
<p>Other local banks can take a cue from NMB’s initiative as it will help their customers to reduce the hassles of making international transactions. Customers have had to miss consuming <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/05/cabs-halts-dstv-payments-asks-customers-to-bring-us-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some products because there were not able to make international payments.</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, banks have had to<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/05/banks-begin-restricting-use-visa-mastercards-outside-zimbabwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> restrict Telegraphic Transfers to plug the outflow of foreign currency.</a> In light of that, NMBZ Holdings has reminded users that its United States Dollar account serves only to receive money but not to make telegraphic transfers outside the country. The bank announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that the United States Dollar account is currently restricted to receiving funds, therefore, outward Telegraphic Transfers will be facilitated through EURO, Rand, and CNY currencies.</p></blockquote>

You can read the press release below:</p>
<blockquote><p><u>May 9, Nairobi</u>:  The African agri-tech space is booming, with the number of startups operating in the market growing 110 per cent over the past two years, and over US$19 million invested into the sector in that period.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://disrupt-africa.com/agrinnovating-for-africa-2018/"><em>Agrinnovating for Africa: Exploring the African Agri-Tech Startup Ecosystem Report 2018</em></a><em>, </em>released today by Disrupt Africa, records 82 agri-tech startups in operation across Africa by the start of 2018, with 52 per cent of these ventures launched in the past two years.</p>
<p>The report tracks annual startup activity in the agri-tech space as early as 2010, but finds this activity remained limited until the end of 2015. The current boom began in 2016, and over the following two years 43 new ventures launched across Africa.</p>
<p>The research shows that while Kenya was the early pioneer of the African agri-tech sector, accelerating interest in West Africa over the past two years means this region now dominates the market; and is home to two of the top three agri-tech ecosystems on the continent.</p>
<p>Currently, Kenya and Nigeria tie in first place as the top two agri-tech markets on the continent; while Ghana places third. Together, these three countries account for over 60 per cent of agri-tech startups active in Africa.</p>
<p>Over the course of this period, over US$19 million has been invested into African agri-tech startups; with annual fundraising figures growing rapidly. The amount of funding raised in 2017 grew by over 121 per cent on the total for 2016.</p>
<p>“The scope for innovation in the agricultural sphere is vast &#8211; a refreshed take on the sector could unlock huge value for the whole of Africa. That’s why this report is so exciting &#8211; it shines a light on the extent to which the continent’s entrepreneurs are already disrupting the agricultural industry. Behind the scenes, there has been formidable acceleration in the agri-tech market recently, and it is one of the most interesting spaces to watch in Africa today,” said Gabriella Mulligan, co-founder of Disrupt Africa.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows how important the agricultural sector is across Africa, but until very recently it remained relatively untouched by tech innovators. That is suddenly changing as entrepreneurs and investors realise the scale of the challenges facing farmers, and spot opportunities to reach huge addressable markets. Our latest report tells you all you need to know if you want to get involved in this still very nascent space,” said Tom Jackson, Disrupt Africa co-founder.</p>
<p>Startups are particularly involved in applying e-commerce to the agriculture industry, with this type of agri-focused e-commerce platform accounting for 32.9 per cent of startups. Information and knowledge sharing platforms are also popular; while a substantial number of entrepreneurs are focused on delivering fintech solutions for farmers.  A total of six sub-sectors are examined in the report.</p>

Winning is materialised by competing. One cannot race alone without other contenders and claim to be a winner, racing alone is just mere exercising.</p>

Hence rivalry is essential for individual and enterprise development. In recent times the Zimbabwean business market has become very intriguing with companies outdoing each other to get and keep customers. In some <g class="gr_ gr_174 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="174" data-gr-id="174">instances</g> these marketing clashes are developing into potential market-wars-like. The consumer, for once in a long time in this country, becoming a beneficiary not a victim of circumstances.</p>
<h4>Soft drinks market</h4>
<p>According to Modern Marvels in the height of the early ‘cola wars’ between <g class="gr_ gr_98 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="98" data-gr-id="98">Coca Cola</g> and Pepsi-Cola, the latter was struggling and near collapse. In the 1930’s Charles Guth was the owner of Pepsi-Cola, close to bankruptcy he offered to sell it to <g class="gr_ gr_100 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="100" data-gr-id="100">Coca cola</g> then owned by Robert Woodruff who <g class="gr_ gr_99 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="99" data-gr-id="99">out rightly</g> refused to purchase and end forever their perennial rival which has continued to fight tooth and nail for <g class="gr_ gr_127 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="127" data-gr-id="127">market</g> share up to this 21st century. This rejection emboldened Charles Guth to bounce back with the 1934 great depression giving him his opportunity. Americans were facing high unemployment and lack of <g class="gr_ gr_129 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="129" data-gr-id="129">disposal</g> income and <g class="gr_ gr_101 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="101" data-gr-id="101">Pespi</g>-cola radically reduced its prices (as illustrated in the table below) to increase sales which had extremely positive results and propelled them back to not only survival but competing as well.</p>

<p>Accelerate the hands of time, more than eight decades later, the two antagonists are now multi-billion dollars’ worth of multinational companies but the friction is relentless.</p>
<p>In a sub-Saharan country in its own, maybe worse, <g class="gr_ gr_166 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="166" data-gr-id="166">situation</g> of economic depression, <g class="gr_ gr_94 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="94" data-gr-id="94">Coca cola</g> has <g class="gr_ gr_95 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="95" data-gr-id="95">years long</g> built market share and production infrastructure. Enter 2017-18; Enter the non-subservient <g class="gr_ gr_96 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="96" data-gr-id="96">Pespi</g> setting up a production plant and its management rescreens the same old strategic attack. Cutting down the price of their soft drinks without compromising neither the quantity nor the quality as a market penetration strategy. This which is a relief as Zimbabweans are used to some Chinese companies who usually come to Africa with products reduced on both price and quality. At the time of writing a <g class="gr_ gr_97 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="97" data-gr-id="97">Coca cola</g> soft <g class="gr_ gr_169 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="169" data-gr-id="169">drink</g> pet 500ml is going for a $1 and Pepsi pet 500ml is $0.50 cents.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwean market <g class="gr_ gr_132 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="132" data-gr-id="132">is arguably price</g> sensitive because the average person is finding it hard to earn an extra dollar to spend. In the <g class="gr_ gr_134 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="134" data-gr-id="134">past</g> there <g class="gr_ gr_133 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="133" data-gr-id="133">has</g> been soft drinks imports which had a well-defined target market of <g class="gr_ gr_136 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="136" data-gr-id="136">low income</g> consumers and they thrived. The basics to infiltrate the soft drink market is for a manufacturer to convince middle merchants to stock their product with further re-stock levels determined by the rate the product is being bought by consumers. Therefore the manufacturer is greatly responsible for promoting and positioning its products so that the end users buy it and subsequently wholesalers, retailers, vendors, related-supply chain merchants will be eager to restock in increased quantities.</p>
<p>Therefore price is not the only factor; there are others like target marketing; brand acceptance and loyalty; product distribution, awareness, assortment and accessibility amongst some elements which determine success.</p>
<p>It is still premature to conclude but the early response of the market seems to be similar to the 1934 American scenario. The general increase in product availability and consumption of Pepsi products in the Zimbabwe market must be an eyesore for the market leaders. Yet is this sustainable in the long run? What <g class="gr_ gr_158 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="158" data-gr-id="158">other distribution, collaboration and marketing tactics will</g> they use as reinforcements? Will <g class="gr_ gr_102 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="102" data-gr-id="102">Coca cola</g> be drawn into a price war? How resistant is <g class="gr_ gr_103 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="103" data-gr-id="103">Coca cola</g> brand loyalty against a more formidable competitor? Consumers can only wait and see where this rivalry will end up to, hoping that they continue to benefit in the meantime. Exciting times are ahead, you can just wish you were sitting in the boardroom corner observing strategy developments of these larger than life soft drinks entities.</p>
<h4>Retailers’ promotions</h4>
<p>The Zimbabwean retailing market has recently been re-invaded by the coupon redeeming sales promotions strategy. I remember in the early 1990s <g class="gr_ gr_88 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="88" data-gr-id="88">Coca cola</g> used a typical promotion to give out water glasses and Calypso brand offered a small hand-held self-branded puzzle which at one time became crazes. In the international <g class="gr_ gr_151 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="151" data-gr-id="151">market</g> these have been available for a long time but the drive recently has turned to online advertising, promotion and purchases. They have taken it steps further with websites like <g class="gr_ gr_89 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="89" data-gr-id="89">ebates</g> and coupon cabin for online coupons and promotions codes. This which is another business system in-waiting for the Zimbabwean market as our internet usage <g class="gr_ gr_153 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="153" data-gr-id="153">grows,</g> only requires customization for our needs and wants.</p>
<p>Anyway back to our local situation, the idea behind this is to entice the customer to keep making repeat purchases as they attain to reach the redemption target to get their price. Retail giants who have noticeably, recently used this strategy are OK Zimbabwe and Pick n Pay. Customers are issued with stickers/ points and once they reach a stated level they collect cooking utensils. Personally, I saw that the Pick n Pay strategy has been <g class="gr_ gr_146 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="146" data-gr-id="146">relatively</g>, highly popular; judging by the number of their prices I see in the kitchens of people I know and the fact that wives always get angry if men buy goods from another shop and come back home sticker-less. How many times have you been enticed to increase your purchase quantity to reach the round off figure of $5, $10, $15……in order to get one more sticker? <g class="gr_ gr_148 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="148" data-gr-id="148">Ok</g> Zimbabwe seemed to have lost the plot on their deemed to be outdated and of <g class="gr_ gr_87 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="87" data-gr-id="87">lessor</g> quality utensils they were offering on redemption, at least that’s my perception!</p>
<p>Now a marketing war is brewing here because the Zimbabwean consumers are warming up more to the coupon/points promotions than the traditional ‘buy and stand a chance to win’ tactics. It’s a no-brainer really, a customer has more control in the coupon redeeming scenario and a guarantee that they will get the price if they continue purchasing to a stated level. In the buy and stand a chance to win it’s a gamble which many people will attest that they never win. Now if Pick n Pay continues with its promotion during a time when the popular OK grand challenge will be running. Now the questions will be;</p>
<p>Will a consumer be prepared to go for the guaranteed redeemable sticker or a gamble to win bigger prices which they are virtually fighting for with every other adult person in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>On the other <g class="gr_ gr_93 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="93" data-gr-id="93">hand</g> will the consumer also reach a disutility level with utensils when they feel they redeemed as <g class="gr_ gr_92 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="92" data-gr-id="92">much</g> utensils as they need and it seizes to be a motivator?</p>
<p>How effective will it be to use both strategies the coupon redeeming system and the ‘buy more and stand a chance to win’ promos? Will they complement each other or set back each other?</p>
<p>What is more enticing, reducing products prices or offering a redeemable price? Or both?</p>
<p>Exciting marketing times indeed! This marketing warfare does not only include these mentioned two retailers but other market challengers who want to attract more buyers. Companies need to conduct detailed market <g class="gr_ gr_85 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="85" data-gr-id="85">researches</g>, regular customer satisfaction measurements, markets analysis and use them to come up with marketing strategies <g class="gr_ gr_122 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="122" data-gr-id="122">not</g> the other way round. The days of taking the consumer for granted are past gone, there are more options out there and the customer is not as desperate or irrational as some companies further assume.</p>
<p>There continues to be a lot of insensible promotions out there which are basically insulting the customer’s intelligence really. Especially the points system <g class="gr_ gr_113 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="113" data-gr-id="113">has</g> been greatly abused by some companies who tell people to buy or use a certain system to earn points in order to stand a chance to win. There is no mention of the number of points you need to <g class="gr_ gr_121 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="121" data-gr-id="121">win,</g> or proper communication of the attained points by previous winners. In <g class="gr_ gr_118 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="118" data-gr-id="118">reality</g> the customer is walking blindly in the promotion and the companies might think that the promotion is effective when in actual terms the customer was still going to buy or use the service regardless of the ‘pie in the sky’ promotions.</p>
<p>There are more marketing wars in Zimbabwe, as the market promises to be enthralling for consumers and <g class="gr_ gr_83 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="83" data-gr-id="83">nerve racking</g> for selling companies.</p>

Although the culprit was caught before he managed to get away with it, Zimra hasn’t yet recovered the money. The employee, Stephen Moreka is employed as an infrastructure administrator by Zimra, no wonder he hacked the server.</p>
<p>Zimra commissioner general stated that it had intercepted a staffer, who tried to transfer funds into other people’s accounts.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/05/zimra-catch-2-million-fraud-suspect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We ran an internal investigation and we are glad that we have finally captured the suspect from the IT (information technology) department.</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Here is how he did it</h4>
<p>The guy hacked his way into Zimra’s Paynet server and then without permission, he started to upload files with a total value of $2,3 million. He then went on to siphon the actual $2,3 million from Zimra’s server into various bank accounts of other people (most likely his accomplices).</p>
<p>To cover his trail, Stephen Morekan cleared the server logs by deleting files on the server.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, a Zimra accounting officer noticed the files and recovered them. Zimra then proceeded to report the issue to the police who apprehended him and now the matter is before the court.</p>
<p>Even though Zimra now knows where the money is, it&#8217;s still yet to recover it from the accounts the money was sent.</p>
<h4>A heads up for organizations on &#8216;inside jobs&#8217;</h4>
<p>Cyber-attacks resulting in the loss of money and private information has led many to believe that outside hackers are the only way companies can lose control over their money and data. While these events obviously need to be taken seriously, many companies ignore the possibility of internal employees being responsible for the loss of private information. It can be hard to scrutinize the people working daily to build up your organization, but system breaches coming from inside the business aren&#8217;t something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>An employee has better access to a network computer that will readily connect to the heart of a system which is its most vulnerable part. Insiders also tend to know sensitive information including passwords, key passes, co-employees’ computing habits, system vulnerabilities, etc.</p>
<p>So while guarding against &#8216;outside&#8217; hackers, organizations have to make sure that they are not overly exposed to &#8216;inside jobs&#8217; at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zbc.co.zw/traffic-congestion-intensifies-in-harares-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traffic jams are now a usual thing in Zimbabwe especially when it has rained and around 5 pm.</a> Car drivers can sometimes take an awful 30 minutes stationed at one position.</p>
<p>Well, Google Maps has come to the rescue to help you avoid traffic jams. Zimbabweans will be happy to know that <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/02/maps-go-is-now-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a> is now able to display traffic conditions in real time on major roads and highways. With the ability to track traffic conditions, this app may slowly become integral in our daily life.</p>
<p>Google Maps has been in use in Zimbabwe for many years but this feature of showing traffic conditions was not available. Google has now silently added this feature in Zimbabwe.</p>
<h4>How does Google Traffic work?</h4>
<p>Where Traffic data is available, Google Maps can now help you identify which route to choose and how much time your trip might take based on current traffic conditions. To do this, live and historic data is refreshed regularly to provide you with accurate and timely estimates.</p>
<p>The service will show traffic bars for half an hour before and a few hours after the current time to help users on their journey. The App is able to tell road users which roads are busy with a show of colors that range from red (bad traffic) to green (good traffic/no congestion).</p>
<p>So, for instance, if for some reason someone at Joina City wants to go to Rufaro Stadium, Google Maps can now tell you that it may take an estimated 15 minutes, in current traffic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use this new feature, click the “Get directions” button on the left-hand panel. Then, enter start and end points before clicking the blue “GET DIRECTIONS” button.</p>
<p>You will then see suggested routes for your trip, as well as the distance between points and the length of time the trip would usually take without any traffic. Below this, you will see updated travel time information based on current road conditions. On mobile phones, you have to click &#8220;Satellite&amp; traffic&#8221; and see the traffic conditions.</p>
<p>However, sometimes Google Maps will not provide accurate traffic speeds for a route and traffic conditions for some routes will not be provided.</p>

<h4>New entries</h4>
<p>There are two new entries in this list: Nehanda Radio and Zimbabwe Today. In the lists prior to this we had missed this entirely but fortunately one of the readers alerted us of these omissions in the comments section.</p>
<p>The reason why we missed quite a few and have been continuing to update this list is because it was a spontaneous list where we listed the entries we were thinking of from the top of our heads. So once again if we missed a site that is popular just get in the comments section and help us keep growing this list</p>
<h4>Trends</h4>
<p>Pages per visit have been steadily rising. Every entry &#8211; except the new entry of course- in the top 10 and almost throughout the entire list has seen the pages that viewers visit each time they are on the site rise. I&#8217;m not sure if this is because publishers are linking to other stories well in their articles or if its because the quality of journalism is rising, only readers can attest to that one.</p>
<p>Maybe&#8217; it&#8217;s because of stories such as the legalization of Marijuana but that story was not covered on Techzim until recently but our views per visit also rose so it might not be that.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer!</h4>
<p>The statistics provided by similarweb (i.e. Monthly Visits and Pages/Visit ) are only estimates that can help inform readers that may want to advertise on these platforms but these are not the exact stats and if there are any errors for these stats it&#8217;s not on us. The statistics that we compile ourselves are in relation to Twitter followers and Facebook likes and if there is an error there, well, that&#8217;s on us.</p>
<p><em>[For the sites that have <strong>N/A</strong> under <strong>Total Visits </strong>and <strong>Pages/Visit, </strong><a href="https://www.similarweb.com/">similarweb.com</a> could not produce the required statistics. We proceeded to rank these using their popularity on Facebook. We chose FB over Twitter because it is used more widely in Zimbabwe and for most if not all sites on this list, their Facebook following is far larger than the corresponding Twitter fan base.]</em></p>

The online payment can be done using Mastercard and Visa payment models only.</p>
<p>Previously, the <a href="https://www.evisa.gov.zw/#/Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online visa application platform</a> only facilitated the application of Visas but visitors were not able to pay for them on the platform. Visitors had to put up with delays at airports and border posts to pay for the visas they would have applied online.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the payment system is being introduced to enable travelers to pay in advance so that thereby reducing delays on arrival. Immigration principal director, Clemence Masango said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have rolled out an online visa application and payment system which allows visitors to apply and pay in advance thereby reducing delays on arrival.</p></blockquote>
<p>Above all, Mr. Masango said that the facility is being introduced in tandem with the government’s drive to improve the ease of doing business which is part of <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/zimbabwe-is-open-for-business-but-seems-closed-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8216;Zimbabwe is open for business&#8217;</a> slogan touted by <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/ed-mnangagwa-increases-online-presence-with-a-new-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Mnangagwa’s</a> government.</p>
<p>The system is handy especially for those from <a href="http://www.chronicle.co.zw/online-visa-payment-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Group C countries</a> who previously had to go and apply at the embassies.</p>
<h4>However, it’s not for everyone.</h4>
<p>The payment portal will not support visitors from China because China does not support Mastercard and Visa payment options (Mastercard and Visa are the only payment channels currently available) and as such, they will continue to pay on arrival.</p>
<p>Sadly, we currently don’t have reviews about how this payment facility performs but we suspect that it works pretty well since the platform uses renowned companies, Visa and MasterCard in processing the payments.</p>
<p><span>The Immigration Department said that it is also working on introducing <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/05/immigration-launches-e-visa-application-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine-generated visas</a> to minimize errors by reducing human interference in the process of getting a Visa.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>We are also intending to roll out the machine generating visa at the moment the officer does it manually and stamp the passport but when we go machine generated, the machine will do that to minimise human error. The machine will capture your biodata from the passport, print it in less than 30 seconds onto visa sticker and when we they scan the passport the machine generates the sticker and pastes without human finger doing that.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m still trying to grasp how exactly both Dala and Wala work but in the meantime you can check out the interview we had with Trish and Samer and get some insight from it. Wala recently became available in Zim and this is something we will be continuing to cover as our understanding of the service evolves.</p>
<p>You can read the interview below:</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em><em>: </em>So we’re here with Trish Martinez and Samer Saab from Wala Digital and Dala Foundation. They’re just going to introduce the company, what they are doing, and their Zim roll out and what that is about. So, welcome guys!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong><em>:</em> Wala and Dala are separate entities. Wala is a mobile financial platform. Essentially it’s the money app that sits between banks, financial service providers, and value added service providers and consumers to create more efficient systems. The biggest problem that we saw years ago while working in Africa was that consumers bear the burden of these systems. There are fees for every action they make with the bank or the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to send money, to enquire about their account and that is in result dis-incentivising consumers from wanting to participate in these systems. “It’s easier for me to use cash because I don’t have to pay for it.” So Wala aims to remove those fees, remove the access problems to create more efficiency so that consumers can get down the path towards financial freedom.</p>
<p>So the app is essentially a bank in your pocket. You can access loans, savings accounts, pay for bills, buy airtime, buy data, you can send money to anyone anywhere free and in order to do all this, the zero fee has been our vision and mission since day one.</p>
<p>We knew we couldn’t use the existing payment rails, we couldn’t use the banks, we couldn’t use MNOs because that’s how they make money and they want to keep charging fees so last year we issued a new cryptocurrency called Dala and Dala actually enables instant borderless micro-payments. So, the big problem we saw here – on top of these fees- was that consumers throughout Africa are actually sending very small payments and topping up in very small amounts and average is actually less than 80c (in USD), so imagine paying fees on a 50c transaction, its crazy.</p>
<p>With Dala you can move any amount of money instantly to anyone anywhere for free and our goal has just been this currency, this digital good for consumers throughout the continent, so we recently launched in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda and this year we will be expanding to over ten markets in eastern, western and southern Africa as well as the UK.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em><em>:</em> What’s been the traction like in Uganda, South Africa and now Zim? And we are talking about Wala now?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: Well both. So, Wala is the launch partner of Dala. You can go in the Wala app and Dala crypto, you can get rewarded in it (Dala), but we started Wala through a Facebook groups three years ago and that’s how we ended up growing this community. We’ve had over a million people from the Facebook groups sign up to just engage and learn more.</p>
<p>We launched almost a little over two weeks ago in these markets and we didn’t really know what to expect. We were hoping for some slow growth because we knew it would take time to build trust but in Uganda we’re literally growing exponentially. Like I said earlier, we’re seeing at certain times 60 new users per minute. The exciting thing is its catching on; people see value in the zero fees, people see value in Dala and what they can do with it – that’s in Uganda. In SA and Zim, it’s slower moving but that’s just because we need to build a presence, which is what we are doing now and why we are in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: Okay. Going back to Uganda, what are the people using Wala for? Are they buying airtime, sending each other money?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: So the funny thing is, users average time in the app is really high. Users are spending 5-10 minutes in the app and the reason for this is two fold:</p>
<p>They are actually meeting their friends in person and showing them how to use the app. Actually we have users who are becoming our ambassadors without us even asking them to. The big thing for them is they get rewards. When they sign up they get rewarded in Dala tokens, when they take a selfie they get rewarded, they go purchase in our market they get rewarded the first time and they get unlimited rewards for inviting friends. People are just going out, active educating people, signing them up to Wala and then get rewarded. With all these rewards they get to buy airtime, data, pay for bills.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing people deposit in Uganda. We’ve had a number of people sending mobile money payments to us because they wanna buy Dala because it would be cheaper for them to purchase in our market than it is with the local telcos…</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: …And that’s not expensive for you? The rewards that people then use to…</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM:</em></strong> Of course it is, but it is part of our strategy. We see it as an acquisition strategy. When we did our token sale we set aside a large portion of tokens to provide as rewards to either consumers or enterprisers because in order to seed his markets and actually thrive at action you need to just put tokens in the hands of users and getting them using it so that they start trusting it and want to actually start purchasing</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ:</em> I saw you mention that the cost of acquisition and you are comparing that to …</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM: </em></strong>That was our community. So today, it varies. We started with higher rewards – for example, people were earning higher rewards for inviting a friend but we’ve already dropped that number down because we were growing way too fast but what’s interesting is we can change rewards. We can even have days where we offer higher rewards to start driving more growth and we can add more rewards for like savings accounts. Your savings goal will reward you for that. We found that rewards are actually very successful – who doesn’t like free money?- but also an important tool because it also builds trust. We are not telling you to get something that you don’t want, but it’s important to actually do this because you’re able to trust the consumers…</p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: … And ultimately we want to change behaviours and it’s very difficult to change a behaviour. It’s not about just putting your product out and saying ‘Here! Start using this’, you have to get people who have been using cash their entire lives or who now prefer other wallets over other ways  to pay to start putting money into the system regularly and transacting that way or making this the new default medium for transacting and you can’t expect that anyone will just do that upon receiving an application. We are taking the view that today someone is zero-percent  using  Wala and tomorrow – maybe because of rewards- they maybe at five percent and over time as we continue to incentivise and you start to understand that the app is the best way for them to use and manage their money and then overtime time they become hundred-percent digitally engaged in the finances and that’s what we are ultimately trying to drive at because not only is it a benefit for us as a company but we believe that’s the best pass for driving growth for consumers as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: So coming to Zim, you mentioned that you’re partnering a bank. What’s the roll out strategy and how big a partnership is this and what will be the big ‘why’ for me (the user)?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: Right now we have a banking partner and we haven’t officially announced it but that will be announced later on and now there is another bank that is interested.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Zimbabwe is that there is literally a monopoly in the market. EcoCash has around 90% of funds flowing through their service and then they have 98% market share, and the banks are struggling and they really don’t know what to do, so they are collectively looking for a new wallet that can compete with EcoCash.</p>
<p>I think the government probably wants to try and support more efforts because they do want competition to help consumers and give them more choice and that’s what we see as being a great opportunity for us to come in and why these banks are trying to work with us.</p>
<p>So, roll out is users would be able to get savings accounts and loans through a bank partner around the wallet app. It’s a little bit of a different experience because with  savings accounts you need to go through KYC, so with Wala right now we only ask for your phone number and we don’t require any identification whereas to get a bank account you need to generate proof of address, your ID and things like that so it’s more of an investment from the consumer to want to get these products but there’s a lot of value to get a loan, to start a business is a big deal as well, so roll out is integrating these, getting them live in the Wala app so that any consumer can apply and access them.</p>
<p>With these bank partners we are also going to be integrating to retailers and have merchants so that cash-in and cash-out, and deposit withdrawal is easily accessible. It’s more-so for the urban based consumer. You can go to OK Zim or Pick n Pay and be able to go cash-in and out or even purchase at these locations to your Wala app with a QR code but in rural areas it becomes a little more difficult which is why we are working with partners like MVender who have built up merchant neworks and are scaling them these networks to reach the harder to find areas where these retailers aren’t located.</p>
<p>In terms of why, just look at EcoCash. It’s an easy thing to compare the fees alone, right? Do you want to pay to send money, to receive money, to check your balance, to buy airtime, for bills? Nobody wants to pay for these things and if you can do it for free why wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>Secondly, once we have all these retail locations, the cash-in cash-out points it’s easier for a consumer to want to transition to this because we have touched every single end point where you ever want to spend money or take money, and that’s the ultimate goal. To build an ecosystem you need to touch any place somebody is going to spend their money.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: Regarding cash-in and cash-out will there be fees for those?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: We don’t control cash-in and cash-out so if – let’s say- we partner with OK Zim or Pick n Pay and they charge fees, we can’t control that. Our biggest focus has been ; we want users to keep money in the Wala ecosystem. We said this earlier that  if you’re using money in this system inside this app it will never cost you anything but the second you take out to cash somebody pays for that and we have no control over that unless we built that system. Right now we are not building systems, we are focused on just integrating and keeping a good experience but at the end of the day its still cheaper to use us even if there is a fee from cash-in cash-out than it would be to use an EcoCash.</p>
<p><strong>TZ: But I can cash in right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: In Zim right now there is no cash-in cash-out. The only way in Zim you can get Dala is by getting rewarded</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: Oh, I have to be ridiculously active isn’t? I should be doing lots of stuff…</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>:(laughs) The funny thing is, people in Uganda  have quickly discovered that they can make a lot of money by just… We’ve essentially created jobs for people in Uganda because they are going out spreading the word, signing up people, we pay large amounts for referrals, so they are making money everyday and then paying for the bills and all these things…</p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: They’re actually educating people on the app, because they have to teach you how to use it because if someone then registers they get a small reward and that person wants to know what do I do with this reward. So through that, there are actually teaching people, “Oh look how great this app is.” The rewards incentive is actually working the way that we want because not only is it getting people to spread the word but it’s forcing them to show people how to use the app and along the way demonstrating that this app is actually really cool.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: In terms of merchants, I now you said you’ll be working on that as the focus is on the user but right now how many merchants do you have? What are the practical things that people can go buy?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: So this is all through our partnership with Mvender. They have built out their merchant network throughout Africa to a hundred thousand merchants and its growing. Zimbabwe is their biggest market. We haven’t turned on the merchant network yet. We are doing an integration with them now so that a user in Zim could actually go in the app look for the closest merchant and go to cash-in cash-out. In the app users can buy airtime, data, pay for bills, DSTV and they can do this not only in Zimbabwe but in 10 other countries. So, if you have family in Malawi you an buy them airtime or pay for their bills etc. In every market the products vary depending on who the provider is but our market is important because we want to encourage the purchase of more products that can help people in their lives. We are going to be integrating things like airplane tickets, bus tickets and anything that starts seeing a demand for users its easy to kind of turn on an integration with the app</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: Beyond Zim… you mentioned that its just one of the markets you are launching within the next six months…</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: We are live here (Zimbabwe), but banking is not available yet and no cash-in cash-outs. Today in Zimbabwe somebody can sign up, get rewards and go buy in our market (in their app). This year we plan to be in Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and Uk, about 11 markets in total.</p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: This all works because of the Dala cryptocurrency, because without that we couldn’t grow this fast and we couldn’t reach all of these markets, because remember with cryptocurrency its global – it doesn’t have borders- and this enables us to deliver the same experience to consumers, whether one is in Zimbabwe or Australia right? And that’s a very unifying thing. Soon we’re going to start seeing companies that have nothing to do with Wala start using Dala’s for their own operations as well  and that’s what the future of Dala is beyond what we are doing with Wala and that’s what’s going to help it become a  global currency</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: Correct me if I’m wrong, Wala is like the first biggest customer… partner for Dala but Dala is the end game</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: So there’s actually already been one big announcement that was made by the Dala Foundation; a big adopter to provide fertiliser on credit to farmers in Southern and East Africa. So, there’s this large global fertiliser company that’s going to be  bringing in fertiliser and providing it to farmers and that entire ecosystem is going to run using the Dala token.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: The Dala Foundation?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: Yes, the Dala Foundation is the entity that issued the crypto.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ:</em> What’s the biggest utility for the crypto right now? You mentioned partnership with local exchange. What are people outside Wala going to find the utility being?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: I think beyond Wala, it’s still too early to tell. I think  that you’re going to start seeing corporations, enterprises adopt it in manners that we can’t even forecast at this point. One of the things we have been more surprised by is that there is actually potential to solve problems for these players as well and not just consumers. We’re going to see more and more of that in the next six months but beyond that there is so much that will start happening that we won’t even see because we don’t even need to.. Because it is accessible through the APIs and it’s an open source project so people will start adding it to their own services and accepting it. I’m actually very curious to see which direction it does go.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: So cross-border is mostly the utility inside Wala right now; in terms of seeing the same currency that someone in Jo’burg can see and someone in Kampala can see and we can send it to each other.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: Yes, instantly and for free.</p>
<p><strong><em>SS</em></strong>: Then also, you can use that Dala inside of Wala to purchase goods and services – including your value-added services like airtime data.</p>
<p><strong>TZ: Well, you’re the first crypto that’s actually usable, is it?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: Bitcoin obviously has adoption but it hasn’t gotten to the point where it’s an actual currency. In Africa, South Africa is one of the only places where maybe you could go to a coffee shop and pay with Bitcoin but nobody wants to do that and everyone in the Crypto world is crying out for use cases and we are like “We are right here!!”</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: Maybe that’s because you’re not talking about it as a crypto, so for your wallet user it’s just that value token that they can use.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TM</em></strong>: Now we are (talking about it), I think we’ve been a little quiet and just heads down focusing on delivering but next week I’m going to New York for Blockchain Week and presenting at Ethereal summit to kind of unleash this and get people excited about the potential for Africa because everyone is  focused so much on the US but crypto will drive a revolution here because there are problems that need to be solved and we can solve them with this technology. That’s why we are so bullish on this and really believe that it’s going to drive massive change.</p>
<p><strong><em>TZ</em>: Well we believe so too and it’s going to be exciting! Thanks guys…</strong></p>

<p>Now as part of the growth plans, WhatsApp Business could soon be supported on<a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-finally-developing-the-ios-business-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> iOS devices (Apple devices).</a> Currently, the app is not supported on iOS but a pre-release edition has been shown on WhatApp’s <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-finally-developing-the-ios-business-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog, WABetaInfo</a>. This suggests that WhatsApp is likely to be working on a version for iOS users.</p>
<p>The currently available version of the app does not contain many of the business-related features available on the Android version. The absence of these features, including <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/02/whatsapp-business-now-available-zimbabwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labels and Quick Replies,</a> means that app is currently under development but not ready to be rolled out yet. The company was spotted testing the Greeting Message feature which is used to send a welcome message to any first-time customer.</p>

<p>But for now, there is no solid deadline for the development. But considering that the app lacks many features that the current Android version of WhatsApp Business has, we expect it to be a long time.</p>
<p>WhatsApp Business has been fairly successful among the Android crowd. But, amidst the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/facebook-loses-37-billion-in-share-value-as-the-stock-market-reacts-to-its-data-sharing-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data controversy that Facebook is dealing with,</a><span> WhatsApp has assured users about privacy and encryption of messages.</span></p>
<p>It addressed business users specifically, assuring them that <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/26000103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it does not read messages sent to businesses.</a> But, it also stresses on the fact that multiple operators or parties might be able to see the message.</p>

It appears the <a href="https://news.pindula.co.zw/2018/04/30/licence-to-produce-mbanje-at-50-000/">legalization of <em>mbanje, </em>aka weed, aka mary jane, aka marijuana, aka cannabis, aka <em>ganja</em> will continue to capture headlines</a>.</p>
<p>Below is the press release they sent us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pot market is poised to get much more exciting as mbanje production becomes legal in Zimbabwe. Jugnoo, India’s largest on-demand service provider forays in Zimbabwe’s weed rush with the launch of complete technology suite for Cannabis online ordering &amp; delivery business powered by Jungleworks on 8th May 2018. JungleWorks provides businesses an uber for weed model to help them start selling medicinal cannabis online right away.</p>
<p>Marijuana online business has become less complicated with JungleWorks Cannabis Business suite. It is a complete technology suite that empowers marijuana business by providing website, mobile app, manager dashboard and a driver app. The suite also provides an intelligent CRM, Real-Time Chat, Route Optimization, multiple payment options and Business Analytics dashboard. In addition to this, JungleWorks also offers different menu styles to show off the cannabis products in your local language with multiple language feature.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Samar Singla, CEO &amp; Founder of Jugnoo and JungleWorks, said “This recent move by the government of Zimbabwe to legalize medicinal cultivation is a step towards disruption in this industry with technology.

<p>Samar added “We are excited about the launch and expects to grow multi folds in future. On our platform, dispensaries can manage all of their products, orders, deliveries and delight their patients with real-time chat.

<p>The Econet agent is alleged to have been cheated by a syndicate of two people who claimed to be relatives of the defrauded customer that were seeking to replace his sim.</p>
<h4>What really happened?</h4>
<p>A customer traveled to South Africa and then the relatives of the customer approached an Econet agent to make a sim replacement under the pretense that they had been sent by the customer. The supposed relatives only had the customer’s identification number to validate their claim to the Econet agent that they were the customer’s relative.</p>
<p>After the Econet agent replaced the Sim card, the relatives then went on a spree of transferring a total of $3346 from the customer’s Steward, CBZ account, and various Ecocash wallet accounts.</p>
<p>When the defrauded customer discovered this, he went on to contact Econet Zimbabwe who then lodged a complaint to the police leading to the arrest of the relatives and the Econet agent.</p>
<p>The 3 men are going to appear before the magistrate today.</p>
<h4>What does Potraz say about Sim card replacement?</h4>
<p>It is mandatory for customers to produce a police report to replace their Sim cards.</p>
<p>Statutory instrument of 142 of 2013, the Postal and Telecommunications<a href="http://www.3-mob.com/technology/sim-card-replacement-econets-fault/#.WvFXeIiFPIU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (Subscriber Registration) Regulations,</a> 2013 states that:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>6. (1) Where a mobile phone or SIM card is lost, destroyed or stolen, the owner of that phone or SIM card shall report such loss, theft or destruction in person or through a person duly authorised by him or her to the police and the service provider to whose network the owner subscribed.</em><br />
<em>(2) Any authorized person, who receives the report provided in subsection (a)shall provide the reporter with written proof of the report which shall be accompanied </em>with<em> a reference number.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In this case, the relatives and the Econet agent seem like they just walked into the Econet shop and did a Sim card replacement without a police report despite the existence of this law. This likely could have happened because recently I replaced my Sim card without a police report. So, M<span>obile Network Operators</span> seem like they not implementing this law and <span> Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe</span> is not enforcing it.</p>

The most recent culprit is the ‘black-dot message.’</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/8gznfx/another_whatsapp_crash_message_created_by_me/">a thread on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC4NNUYIIdM">a YouTube post</a>, the message comes in a number of different forms and is quite hard to spot. There are a variety of messages being sent that can crash your Whatsapp, and one of the more popular ones is a “<strong><em>This is very interesting</em></strong>” message that comes with an emoji. Once a reader opens this message their Whatsapp instantly freezes and proceeds to crash.</p>
<p>I really don’t know why anyone would forward this prank unless they are not aware of what the message can actually do. These crashes could result in loss of messages that have not been backed up on the end of the receiver so it might be best if people desist from sending this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>The black dot does not discriminate. Apparently, it affects users on both Android and iOS equally. It is not clear if the bugs can actually access your phone but it appears they just affect Whatsapp</p>
<h4>Recent encounter&#8230;</h4>
<p>I’m yet to encounter the black dot personally but this past weekend I encountered a different ‘bug’ that causes Whatsapp to crash. The message read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Guys I’m Bluestacks’ basically a Zimbabwean… I’m an ethical hacker … I spent 3 hours to develop this virus massage …. It won’t destroy your phone(its interesting)</p>
<p>This message will hang your Whatsapp</p>
<p>Just double click on “don’t touch here”</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>don’t-touch-here</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought it was one of those silly hoaxes but when I touched the “don’t-touch-here” part of the message, my Whatsapp came to a halt and then proceeded to force close. This bug seems to be affecting Android users only and our companions on iOS seem to be immune to this one.</p>
<h4>This is a thing now?</h4>
<p>I’m not sure when these bugs became popular but over the last few days I seem to be coming across them more frequently so I guess this is becoming a trend. Hopefully, none of these bugs will have more devastating effects.</p>
<p>If you have low storage on your phone it might not be the wisest idea to interact with either of these bugs because you could end up losing your messages when your Whatsapp crashes.</p>

I&#8217;m not exactly sure when the app was updated to include this feature but all that matters is that it&#8217;s there now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brace yourselves…</h4>
<p>At the recently ended Zimswitch Payment Conference one person I talked to who works in the banking industry sounded pretty confident that within the next 6 months QR codes would be a payment method in the country.</p>
<p>Based off the developments in the EcoCash app it seems the guy was spot on. He stated that a number of different banks were also looking at this payment method so it does seem this technology will be getting adopted sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The addition of this feature is obviously a forward-looking move as QR payments are yet to actually take off in the country. Last year in March, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/03/new-ecobank-mobile-app-allows-payments-using-qr-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecobank&#8217;s mobile app came with QR code functionality that tapped into the Masterpass QR platform</a> but unfortunately it failed to take off. Later on in, October <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/10/ecobank-introduces-scanpay-a-way-for-you-to-make-payments-much-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecobank launched Scan+Pay in over 30 countries</a> but again it failed to gain traction on the local scene.</p>
<h4>QR has been waiting for its moment in the light&#8230;</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit weird that QR has been around for decades but has just never really found a particular use that made it mainstream. It seems that&#8217;s about to change as QR is being embraced in a number of countries such as South Africa, China, India and Pakistan etc.</p>
<p>Why QR?</p>
<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>Those of you who read publications such as The Verge and GSM Arena may be wondering why we are adopting QR over other payment methods such as NFC (Near Field Communication) or biometric enabled payment methods. The simple answer is QR is easier to access and in a developing country such as ours, NFC or Biometric payments are not justifiable as the phones that have this technology are not commonly available as they are in developed countries.</p>
<p>QR however is accessible to any phone with a camera and that makes it much more useful as the level of entry for QR is much lower compared to NFC or biometrics. Obviously, those with feature phones are not catered for but there are enough people with smartphones to justify EcoCash taking the QR route.</p>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<p>Our current payment methods are not exactly quick, especially in the case of mobile money payments. Customers have to dial in the EcoCash shortcode, then select the amount they have to pay before entering their pin. This has resulted in longer wait times at the tills and if you have ever been in a queue at a shop you probably understand that every second you wait there feels like a second wasted. With QR ,however, customers will just get to the till, scan the QR code at the till and voila! Payment made.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>For merchants the QR system will be much cheaper than the current POS system so it seems there&#8217;s incentive for both the merchants and the customers.</p>
<p>It may not seem like a huge deal from where you are standing, but I think its great and I look forward to this technology and seriously hope this becomes the primary payment technology in the country.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the QR payment option is appearing in the EcoCash app for iOS yet as we discovered the feature on Android. The entire Techzim team happens to be on Android by the way, so if you are on iOS it would be grand if you just commented on whether or not the feature is available on the EcoCash app for iOS.</p>

<p>Pay-As-You-Go or pay-as-you-consume is a pricing scheme in television broadcasting<span> in which viewers are required to pay a fee in order to watch a specific programme.</span></p>
<p>John Ugbe, managing director of <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/04/high-court-stops-multichoice-from-raising-dstv-subscription-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multichoice Nigeria</a> said that pay-as-you-go is something it might consider depending on whether their current business model and available technology would permit it. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pay-as-you-consume is something we may consider if it is technologically possible and the business model supports it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Pay-As-You-Go option would reduce costs on the part of consumers in the sense that DSTV would charge them<span> according to their <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201805040378.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumption only and exclude interference.</a></span></p>
<h4>What does this mean?</h4>
<p>With the emergence of more players in the Nigerian and African Pay-TV market, MultiChoice will not have a choice than to change its stance and adopt the Pay-As-You-Go model. Already, one of its strongest competitors,<a href="http://www.kwese.com/feature-tab-view?field_tab_category_value=Watch+anytime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Kwese TV,</a> last year unveiled its Pay-As-You-Go package. <a href="https://www.freebrowsinglink.com/startimes-pay-per-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarTimes</a> another rising competitor also recently did same. Therefore, MultiChoice has to follow suit or risk losing its customers.</p>
<p>For many years, MultiChoice has been the preferred Pay-TV provider for most Africans as their DSTV decoders are used in many homes. It almost appeared like a monopoly, until recently when other providers like Kwese emerged on the scene. But despite this development, DSTV continues to maintain a competitive edge, thanks to the exclusive rights on premium sports it enjoyed for years. Kwese TV’s entrance into the African market is slowly challenging this status quo.</p>

As recently as two weeks ago we were talking about activity in the Kenyan gaming scene. Now it seems Kenya is at it once again as Microsoft is launching their first Software Testing Centre in Africa.</p>
<p>Microsoft is partnering with Techno Brain Limited (an IT Solutions firm) to make this happen. The centre will be located in Nairobi, Kenya and joins Microsoft’s three other software testing facilities with others in India, China and Poland.</p>
<p>As a result of this new development, Kenyans will get other perks which include early access Windows OS builds. Developers in the country will get to test software before it is available. Since Techno Brain will be responsible for testing and quality assurance, it is believed this partnership will create over a thousand jobs and will also catapult the skill of developers</p>
<p>The Director of Software Engineering at Microsoft Bambo Sofola seems to share the sentiment that Kenya is really a high-potential nation when it comes to tech-related developments. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kenya is said to be Africa’s ultimate technology hub of the future and it is rapidly growing in that area. Microsoft is here to support and enable Kenya and Kenyan’s to excel and achieve that purpose</p></blockquote>
<p>Developments such as these will continue to strengthen Kenya’s position as one of Africa’s most innovative countries in the tech space and the constant developments in the Kenyan tech space really should motivate us to catch up</p>

The scandal has had massive effects which we will talk about in this article but most interestingly, Facebook has been looking at whether they can offer an ad-free version of their social network.</p>
<p>If someday they do decide to go down this path it would be interesting to see how they execute that and it would probably have huge effects on their service and advertisers who have been using the platform.</p>
<h4>Domino effect…</h4>
<p>The effects of the aforementioned scandal have been far-reaching and recent reports have stated that Cambridge Analytica will be shutting down after they declared for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The scandal has also led to the implementation of the GDPR set of laws that are meant to protect user data and limit the power of online entities such as Facebook, and even websites in general. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/whatsapp-updates-minimum-age-requirement-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apps such as Whatsapp saw their age limit rise from 13 to 16 in Europe because of these GDPR laws</a>.</p>
<p>In response to GDPR, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/05/facebook-will-soon-have-a-dating-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook also revised its privacy settings and revised some of their more contentious policies in relation to data harvesting</a>. It is now easier to limit the data you give to apps on Facebook and also third-party data sharing will also now be tightened.</p>
<h4>Facebook also seems to be taking a lot more action</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/facebook-is-said-to-research-ad-free-subscription-based-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Word on the street</a> is Facebook has been conducting market research over several weeks to determine whether offering an ad-free Facebook experience would attract people to join the service and also allay users who are concerned about data privacy. The would-be &#8220;ad-free Facebook&#8221; version would be backed by paid subscriptions.</p>
<h4>Where would the money come from?</h4>
<p>Facebook makes a bulk of their money through ads. Advertisers buy ad-space on Facebook because a large number of people use the social network thus there is a higher chance of getting their products bought if they go to a platform that already has a high user base. At one point Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, Coca Cola and Ford all advertised on the platform and these are huge recognisable companies that would pay fortunes to be on the site.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many people in developing countries would be willing to pay to be on a social network. Even in developed countries I would be surprised if this would be a popular feature and maybe some people would be willing to pay for Facebook as it is a central part of their lives but honestly, I think going down this route would be borderline disastrous…</p>
<h4>The spark Twitter needs?</h4>
<p>If Facebook put a paywall behind their network that could spark a mass exodus to other social networks such as Twitter and Snapchat. Twitter would stand to benefit more as Snapchat and Instagram are very specific social networks with tailored use-cases. Twitter and it&#8217;s more general purpose nature would stand to benefit as it would probably attract most of the disgruntled Facebook users.</p>
<p>This would be great news for Twitter because apart from being very popular the social network is yet to turn a profit since it was founded back in 2006.</p>
<h4>Empty Smoke?</h4>
<p>This news could be empty smoke that is meant to garner goodwill for Facebook as they try to put the Cambridge Analytica. Obviously, an ad-free experience would mean Facebook and Apps on the platform would no longer need to harvest data since there won’t be advertisers to sell to anymore. No data harvest would also mean no data breaches.</p>
<p>I think the ‘ad-free Facebook’ news is coming from them just to remove the target that has been on their back and is also something <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/lawmakers-who-are-trying-to-regulate-facebook-have-no-idea-how-the-internet-actually-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook may use if ever the US government tries to regulate them</a>. In the event of impending regulation, Facebook could just say they are trying to revise their service and made the attempts to better their service. If I had to bet, I do not think this will be happening anytime soon. Let’s wait and see.</p>

The increase will come as great news to Smartcash customers as this will enable them to increase the volume of their transactions.</p>
<p>Smartcash was introduced in 2014 to increase financial inclusion through providing low-cost bank accounts for the unbanked population.</p>
<p>Lite bank accounts have found favor with many people because they have no mandatory minimum account balances and they have no monthly service fees. And CBZ’s agency banking helped it to register as many as <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/07/cbzs-agent-banking-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 000 Smartcash accounts.</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the maximum amount of balance for Smartcash accounts has been increased from $300 to $3000 meaning that those account holders will enjoy keeping large amounts of money at no monthly services fees.</p>
<p>Prior to the introduction of competition in the form of mobile money services financial inclusion in Zimbabwe was limited to unaffordable traditional banking accounts that were largely used by individuals and institutions active in the formal economy.</p>
<p>However, the macro environment has changed significantly with informal services contributing significantly to liquidity. As such banks have had to tailor products that address this market. Thus they came up with low-cost bank accounts such as CBZ Smartcash, FBC Mobile Moola etc.</p>

I see specials from Pick n Pay and offers from Woolworths, and when I travel a few metres after seeing those ads I can actually see the store and possibly even walk in and get that great deal. Haven’t you noticed? Okay then, how about all the ads that bombard you as you scroll down your Facebook feed? Ever noticed how most – if not all – of those ads are from America, and that they are usually related to your interests on the internet? Well, at some point we have to start asking why our own local businesses are not doing the same, that is, aggressively marketing their products and services online, and how they can jump on the wagon of digital marketing.</p>
<p>A simple Google Search will tell you that digital marketing is better appreciated in developed countries than our own African countries. This is a very sad reality, considering Africa stands to benefit more from the digital economy than possibly any other continent right now. The latest reports on digital penetration show that there is a 20% increase in the number of internet users in Africa. Yet our local businesses still fail to take full advantage of the opportunity that digital marketing presents.</p>
<p>A lot of business owners have sadly accepted the myth that digital marketing does not work in Africa. This is simply not true. Many transactions are being completed online by Africans in Africa (not the diaspora). Think of all the transactions that take place on sites like BeForward, AlieXpress and eBay. True, data charges are higher in Africa than anywhere else in the world, but that hasn’t stopped us from purchasing goods online. The kicker is, most of this money is not circulating within the African borders hence it is not serving to grow the economy of our nations.</p>
<p>Another reason why many businesses strongly feel that digital marketing is not relevant in the African context is that most online efforts made by local businesses do not translate to any money. At the end of the day, the profits made from marketing efforts are the true indicator of the success of any marketing campaign. If no real money is brought into the business, then the campaign was a failure. Most local businesses fail to tie their digital marketing efforts to the main objective of the company – which in most cases is to make a profit.</p>
<p>If we are being completely honest, most of our local businesses don’t even understand what digital marketing is. To them, it may seem like aimless posts on social media that do not serve any purpose other than to waste time and divert from their core business. This is not entirely their fault though. For a long time, digital marketing has been presented to us as a very foreign concept that is supposed to work miracles for a business. It is no wonder that to date, senior management still opts for traditional methods of advertising over the new digital marketing “sensation” because at least they are familiar with how it all works. It is only very recently that we have begun to see some education happening on this topic.</p>
<p>One of the most notable efforts made to educate business owners and leaders about digital marketing is the <a href="http://dacafroconvention.refr.cc/techzim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Advertising Convention 4 Africa,</a> which will take place at Cresta Lodge Harare from the 14<sup>th</sup> to the 15<sup>th</sup> of June. This year, the DACAfro convention is running under the theme “Growing Businesses through Digital Platforms”. Digital marketing experts from around the world will come together to share knowledge on how to successfully grow businesses using digital media. Over a hundred delegates are expected to attend from all over Southern Africa.</p>
<h3>What Makes <a href="http://dacafroconvention.refr.cc/techzim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DACAfro</a> 2018  Special</h3>
<p>DACAfro might just be arguably the most global digital marketing convention ever to be held on Zimbabwean soil. Anyone can attend this event from literally anywhere in the world – and we don’t mean through the overdone Facebook live feeds. There are actual webinar tickets on sale, and purchasing one of these means you get online access to the whole convention. Plus, you get to participate in the question-and-answer sections, just like you would if you were physically present for the event.</p>
<h3>However, the Big Question remains: Should You Attend <a href="http://dacafroconvention.refr.cc/techzim">DACAfro</a>?</h3>
<p>The answer to this is: OF COURSE. There is no denying the fact that more and more Africans are beginning to rely on the internet for information on literally anything and everything. This means that if a brand (business or personal) is not found online, it is perceived as being less established and therefore not worth spending money on. Hence, the lack of digital marketing skills in any company can prove to be highly detrimental to the success and profitability of that company. I<strong>f you are a business owner, a CEO, top management, marketing director or you basically call the shots in any organisation, then you absolutely need to attend DACAfro 2018.</strong> Some of the speakers are expected to fly all the way from the UK just for this event. We don’t even need to mention the fact that the networking opportunity that such a convention presents is one that you can’t afford to pass over. Other shot-callers and influencers are expected to attend, so you will get a chance to mingle with like-minded people outside of your own business.</p>

<p><span>Our readers were the ones who brought this to our attention <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by sending us a tip</a> and for that WE THANK YOU. </span></p>
<p><span>The problem has been around for two weeks at least as noted by one our readers. On Econet’s Facebook page several customers were complaining about it but there were no responses that indicated the problem was resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>The service disruption is signified by customers not being able to access the ‘Login’ to enter their details.</span></p>
<p>One of the customers who spoke to us had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am one of those guys who never criticized econet, all the complains they got for me where reasonably explained as every business has its flaws, but after these past two months, I understand the frustrations of the people who criticize econet. I have an online job and I solely rely on their wifi bundles, in the very least I juice $60 worth of bundles per month, and when business is high close to twice that, right now I have 30GIG and for the past two weeks have been unable to connect, can you imagine. And in an as if &#8220;in your face&#8221; move, they are busy promoting cows and goats now, we do not need cows and goats, we just need stable internet for a month straight without any hiccups, is that too hard to ask for</p></blockquote>
<p><span>We reached out to Econet to confirm the existence of such a problem and here&#8217;s their official statement:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Econet Wireless wishes to advise its valued customers that there have been some technical challenges at many of its WiFi hotspots around the country, resulting in customers failing to login to the hotspots.</p>
<p>The company is working to resolve the challenges and sincerely regrets any inconvenience caused as a result of the downtime.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, you heard it, they knew the problem existed yet chose to stay silent all along. We have come to rely on these services and as far as customers are concerned such services have become a right so the least telcos can do is to keep us well informed if there is any disruption to any service no matter how peripheral the service seems.</p>
<p>The first customer who notified us of this probably makes the point much clearer:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Hie, thanks for the great content. You guys are doing an exellent Job. I believe as Zimbabwe begins to progress online wise, the importance of guys like you will surely be seen. I have somewhat of a complaint, or news or a tip however you are going to take this. I have noticed that you guys are an actuall authority tech wise, and these big companies listen to you and not us their customers. </span></p>
<p><span>Well the story is this, Econet wifi </span><span class="il">hotspots</span><span> are suddenly down country-wide, for more than two weeks now. I and a bunch of other guys have online jobs. This means we have to be constantly connected to the internet, and we live in an area where econet 3g speeds are bad (4g has not found its way here yet).This also means we rely on the wifi zone econet brought to our area. So every month we buy wifi bundles (which are very expensive by the way) so that we can be online at all times. However some week or so ago,we noticed that the wifi </span><span class="il">hotspots</span><span>where no longer working. </span></p>
<p><span>We contacted some guys we know across the country who do what we do, and they had the same complaint. We then contacted econet, at first, it seemed as if they did not know their system was down. The customer care representative even said I must have been the first person to call in the complaint, and he promised that the issue had been escalated to the relevant department. Well its now close to the second week now and numerous calls later and there is still no feedback, no message from them and no internet. </span></p>
<p><span>The sad part is some of us bought these expensive bundles and they are in our phones. One thing I know is that there are thousands of us who where taking advantage of this platform all across Zimbabwe, i know so because upon going to their facebook page, I discovered a bunch of the same complaints in the coments section. As I said, I dont know if this is a tip, complaint or just a rant, either way we are voiceless and thus we turn to you.</span><br />
<span>Thank you in advance.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it. Two weeks is too long a time to have a problem with your service and you remain silent about it.</p>

It&#8217;s hard enough being away from those you love, to then have problems when sending money to family just adds to your anxiety.</p>
<p>Before you even send the money there is the question of which remittance service to use? How do you send money safely in a way that allows your family to receive it in its true value? Every other service out there claims to be the real solution for you and they promise almost the same thing all of them. Who do you pick?</p>
<p>Maybe the last time you sent money your relatives received it in bond notes because some unscrupulous agent wanted to keep the US dollars for themselves yet you really wanted your family to receive the money in its full value: you worked for it right? Maybe the last time you sent money your poor money spent the whole week going to try pick up the cash and they were told there was no cash; she only got the money on the 8th day because she woke up at 3am.</p>
<h3>Steward Bank could be your answer</h3>
<p>Steward Bank is guaranteeing cash when your relatives come to collect the money you have sent. No stories, no bond, just cash in USD. You don&#8217;t have to be anxious and pacing the floor from wherever you are wondering whether your dear father will indeed get the cash.</p>
<p>This is particularly a comforting thought when you are sending school fees at this twilight hour and you can&#8217;t afford any delay otherwise mwana anotadza kuenda kuchikoro (the child will not be able to go to school).</p>
<h3>You get choice</h3>
<p>So which remittance service do you use for your relative to be able to collect money from Steward Bank? Take a pick:</p>
<p>Steward Bank has relationships with MoneyGram, Cassava Remit, Hello Paisa, World Remit and Western Union. This gives you flexibility to pick a remittance service you like or that is convenient to you whilst still relying on the Steward Bank guarantee that your relatives will receive the money on time and in cash.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>Cash pickups are available at all Steward Bank branches and at Steward Bank agents at selected Econet Shops. This makes the network quite wide and thus brings the service closer to your relatives.</p>
<p>Now you can send the school fees.</p>

Some time ago Zororo Makamba tackled similar issues about websites that are meant to be a resource for potential investors and others interested in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The sites are not up to date and we make another call to responsible folks: please it&#8217;s very important to have websites that show that indeed the country is serious about business.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what a reader from outside Zimbabwe wrote us concerning the Zimstat website:</p>
<blockquote><p><span> I don&#8217;t understand how Zimbabwe keeps saying it is open for business when they make it difficult for investors to find information. We all know that the best source of economic data in any country would be the National Statistical Office. If you go to the </span><span class="il">Zimstat</span><span> website, they literally have ancient information that makes it difficult to analyse and get that information. Why do I have to write an email and wait for years to get each variable I want. I tried calling them and it was a nightmare to get the kind of assistance I wanted. The Central Bank is better as they publish Weekly Economic Research Reports. However, They have not done a quarterly report or a monthly report and an investor has to put the pieces together. This only makes me wonder the kind of nightmare I will experience if I come to Zimbabwe and want to open a company and carry out some administration processes. Zimbabwe needs to get the basics right.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>They were not done just yet, they wrote us again:</p>

<p>Video and audio calls on WhatsApp are currently available for one-on-one conversations only. But the new feature will allow WhatsApp groups to engage in a video call. In its blog,<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/whatsapp-group-video-calling-sticks-announced-facebook-f8-1845689" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the Facebook-owned company said:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Voice and video calls are very popular on WhatsApp, and we’re excited to share that group calling will be coming in the months ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzSr8x-Iiks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company’s demonstration,</a> four people can take part in a video call at once. Details are still very unclear and there’s no word on audio calls for groups as yet.</p>
<h4>And also stickers are coming</h4>
<p>Soon there will be a new way to interact on WhatsApp as it prepares to introduce stickers to its platform, so users can jazz up their conversations using more than just words and emojis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308194/whatsapp-group-video-calls-stickers-new-features-announced"><img data-attachment-id="1889959" data-permalink="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/05/whatsapp-is-finally-going-to-introduce-group-video-calling-stickers-also-coming-soon/screenshot-11-2/" data-orig-file="https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11.png" data-orig-size="732,404" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot (11)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11-255x141.png" data-large-file="https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11-560x309.png" src="https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11-560x309.png" alt="" width="560" height="309" class="alignnone wp-image-1889959 size-large" srcset="https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11-560x309.png 560w, https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11-160x88.png 160w, https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11-255x141.png 255w, https://t3n9sm.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-11.png 732w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>WhatsApp may be kind of slow to join the party, since other messaging apps like Facebook messenger, Telegram and WeChat introduced stickers some time ago, but better late than never.</p>
<p>Users will also reportedly be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308194/whatsapp-group-video-calls-stickers-new-features-announced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download additional sticker packs from an app store.</a> That means that third-party developers will soon be able to offer playful ways to communicate within the popular messaging app, something that Facebook’s own messaging app, Messenger, has offered for some time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no news as to when this feature will be available to all WhatsApp users.</p>

<p>While Twitter&#8217;s<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/05/change-your-twitter-password-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> investigation did not find indicators of abuse,</a> it recommended that all Twitter users change account passwords and implement additional security protections if not activated already on the account.</p>
<p>This guide walks you through the steps of changing the Twitter account password. It furthermore points to additional security protections that you may want to enable on the account to improve security significantly.</p>
<h4>How do I change my Twitter password?</h4>
<p>While logged into your account, go to</p>
<ul>
<li>Settings and privacy, then Password.<br />
Here, you’ll be able to change your password or recover your current one.</li>
<li>Enter your current password, then a new one</li>
<li>Then press Save changes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How do I create a secure password?</h4>
<p>Many people create passwords that others can easily guess or that hackers can easily decipher to gain access to your account.</p>
<p>If you usually go with ‘password’, &#8216;qwerty&#8217; or ‘123&#8230;’, now is the time to stop.</p>
<p>Strong passwords are usually long and consist of upper and lower case letters, symbols and numbers.</p>

<p>This two-factor authentication process can send a code to your mobile phone number whenever a new device attempts signing into your account with the correct password. Of course, it doesn’t help a whole lot if someone has your phone, but at that point, you will have a lot more to worry about than just Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turning on login verification</a> (Two-Factor Authentication):</p>
<ul>
<li>Click &#8220;Settings and privacy&#8217;.</li>
<li>Choose &#8216;Account&#8217; and then</li>
<li>Read the overview instructions, then click &#8216;Start&#8217;.</li>
<li>Enter your password and click &#8216;Verify&#8217;.</li>
<li>Click &#8216;Send code&#8217; to add your phone number if that’s the verification method you want.</li>
<li>Enter the verification code sent to your phone, hit &#8216;Submit&#8217;, and login verification will then be enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing about 2FA is that even if hackers steal your password when they try to log in your account using another device, they will fail because only the owner will receive the 2FA message on his or her phone.</p>
<p>So even if your password is stolen, with 2FA your account won&#8217;t be hacked.</p>

<p>Mr Saul Chin’anga, a certified Electronic Banking Specialist and the Head of Electronic Banking and Card Services at <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/index.php?title=CBZ_Bank&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">CBZ Bank</a>, presented on the <strong><em>state of interoperability</em></strong> in the finance industry. It was an interesting presentation and made clear what is currently possible in our country when it comes to financial services which work together seamlessly.</p>
<h4><strong>Who are the players?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Banks, Building Societies and MFIs, Development Institutions, Money Transfer Organizations.</li>
<li>MNOS – Telecash, EcoCash, One Wallet</li>
<li>TPPSP (<span>Third-Party Payment Systems</span>) – there appears to be some activity in this space.</li>
<li>Customers</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Interoperability among Banks</strong></h4>
<p>Among banks, the interoperability situation is in a good state. They seem to have most angles covered and they have made strides on making their services work together seamlessly.</p>
<h5><strong>What is possible:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Purchases through shared POS infrastructure.</li>
<li>Deposit collection, school fees and other deposits, where the other banks are not represented.</li>
<li>Funds transfer through ZIPIT</li>
<li>Cash withdrawals through ATMs.</li>
<li>Cash withdrawal in branches</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>What is not possible:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Non-financial transactions</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Interoperability among Banks and MNOs</strong></h4>
<p>The state of interoperability between banks and MNOs is not as seamless as that among banks, but this is a result of the fragmentation of the interoperability in mobile money solutions: a situation we have talked about.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Possible</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Banking Services through pull transactions</li>
<li>Wallet to POS (purchases)</li>
<li>Agency banking services such as account opening.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>What is not possible</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Wallet-to-Wallet transfers</li>
<li>Making payment direct from bank account to merchant code or vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Interoperability among MNOs</strong></h4>
<p>The interoperability issue among MNOs is one that has been has been causing a stir recently: and the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/02/supa-mandiwanzira-tells-econet-telecel-netone-to-have-mobile-money-platforms-that-work-together-or-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government recently ordered the involved MNOs to make their mobile money services work together seamlessly</a>. By interoperability, we are simply looking at a situation where a user of OneMoney can send money from their mobile wallet directly to an EcoCash wallet.</p>
<p>Mr Chin’anga started by looking at what’s not possible because in terms of MNOs not much is actually possible. There is a lack of flexibility and this is a huge stumbling block.</p>
<h5><strong>What is not possible</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Wallet to wallet e-value transfers</li>
<li>Wallet services to another MNO wallet e.g. airtime purchase etc.</li>
<li>Paying other MNO merchant with other wallet</li>
<li>Cash in/out from agent</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>What&#8217;s Possible</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Money transfers between International MTOs and Local Banks, MNOs</li>
<li>Card Services between Banks and International Card Schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr Chin&#8217;anga also made it clear that EcoCash opening their doors to subscribers from other networks is not interoperability and this is something we&#8217;ve talked about before. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/02/telecel-predictably-welcomes-mobile-money-interoperability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other MNOs have also welcomed the idea of &#8216;real&#8217; interoperability</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Benefits of Interoperability</strong></h4>
<p>Mr Chin’anga then touched on the benefits of Interoperability and here are the thoughts he shared:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase financial inclusion of the marginalised economies and the unbanked.</li>
<li>Provides ease of doing business and minimises sunk costs for new players.</li>
<li>Reduces costs of reaching the most outlying parts of the population through the agent network</li>
<li>Reduces the complexity of originators and recipients of transfers having to visit multiple agents to make transactions different networks which is subject to more fees.</li>
<li>It helps to establish standards, rules and ease dispute resolution mechanism.</li>
<li>To agents, it reduces the riskiness of cash flows and costs of holding enough cash through shared cash in/out points</li>
<li>Increase viability of Agents in poorest regions by thump sacking/ bundling transactions</li>
<li>Brings about safe and efficient access to banks, no financial institutions and emerging service providers through expanded retail payments systems open to clearing houses</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What we need to do to increase interoperability</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>We need to limit barriers to entry for new technology. It takes long for players to introduce new technology as the value chain appears to be lethargic.</li>
<li>The industry objective should override individual interests. It is necessary for players to know that the growth of the industry provides a better and bigger space for all players.</li>
<li>Avoid fragmented payment ecosystems and strive for one payment ecosystem.</li>
<li>MNOs need to take note that horizontal interoperability provides the strength needed for vertical integration.</li>
<li>The cell phone handset has ceased to be a communication gadget, rather it has become a payment gadget. So when we talk of more than 100% cell phone penetration, that must translate to banked ratio.</li>
<li>How can we achieve a situation where schemes can work together for the development of the market. Zimswitch, Visa, MasterCard and CUP coming together to create a ubiquitous platform.</li>
<li>How best can the industry promote and accommodate new players offering payment gateways so as to enhance competition and efficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>In conclusion…</strong></h4>
<p>In his conclusion, Saul noted that our digital transactions (in Zim) are increasing due to the liquidity crunch in the country. Small retailers are accepting digital payments because that is the only way for them to stay in business.</p>
<p>He also felt we should take the advantage to ensure that we now have full interoperability which will allow us to develop more financial products and services tailored to meet the requirements of our segmented customers.</p>

<p>Although the company said there is no evidence passwords have been leaked or misused, it is urging its users to update their passwords as a precaution. <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On their blog,</a> Twitter said:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>When you set a password for your Twitter account, we use technology that masks it so no one at the company can see it. We recently identified a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. We have fixed the bug, and our investigation shows no indication of breach or misuse by anyone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you consider changing your password on all services where you’ve used this password. You can change your Twitter password anytime by going to the password settings page.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Twitter notes that it currently has no reason to believe password information ever left Twitter’s system or that these unprotected passwords were accessed by hackers, but the risk of the unknown remains.</p>
<p>Also, Twitter noted that hackers may utilize this current situation by inciting you to panic and letting the hackers have your password via email. Twitter states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>If you receive any email about the need to change your password, even if it&#8217;s from Twitter. Please don&#8217;t click any links inside the email</h4>

They have been given a total of three licenses. Content distribution license, webcasting license and video on demand license. Only one of those licenses makes sense and I am being generous&#8230;</p>
<p>I believe this whole licensing stuff is not progressive and has been overtaken by technology. I believe it is unfair that <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/dr-dish-baz-kwese-tv-licence-court/">Kwese had to fight for a license</a> to broadcast and waste time and resources just so someone can append their signature to some paper that says &#8220;I thus license thee.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Maybe the content distribution license makes sense</h3>
<p>The content distribution license as defined by the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) is for content that is delivered through satellite. This could make sense that it is licensed because satellite uses spectrum which is a finite resource.</p>
<h3>Video on demand?</h3>
<p>I first raised my eyebrows when I saw the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/telone-applies-video-demand-license/">notice to apply for a VOD license that was issued by TelOne</a> last year. Then again when I saw<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/broadcasting-authority-of-zimbabwe-inviting-applications-for-licenses-for-some-stuff-we-didnt-know-needed-licensing/"> BAZ issue an invitation for interested parties to apply for this and other licenses</a>.</p>
<p>The question I asked then is still relevant today: is YouTube licensed to be available here in Zimbabwe? How about Netflix? These are VOD services we are consuming everyday. The story gets worse:</p>
<h3>YouTube is illegal and cannot be licensed legally in Zimbabwe</h3>
<p>Well according to the law VOD services need to be licensed so it follows that YouTube and Netflix being such services need the blessing of BAZ for them to be consumed by you and I. What&#8217;s worse, the law does not even permit YouTube and Netflix to be licensed. Here&#8217;s what the law says:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>(1) Subject to subsection (3), a broadcasting licence shall be issued only to individuals who are citizens of Zimbabwe or to a body corporate in which a controlling interest is held, whether through any individual, company or association or otherwise, by one or more individuals who are citizens of Zimbabwe.</span><br />
<span>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) “controlling interest” means-</span><br />
<span>(a) in relation to the corporate structure of the body corporate—</span><br />
<span>(i) all of the securities in the body corporate; or</span><br />
<span>(ii) securities representing all of the share capital of the body corporate; or</span><br />
<span>(iii) securities equivalent in value to one hundred per centum of the share capital of the body corporate; or</span><br />
<span>(iv) securities entitling the holders thereof to all the votes in the affairs of the body corporate.</span><br />
<span>(b) in relation to the governance of the body corporate, that the majority of persons who—</span><br />
<span>(i) determine the policy of the broadcasting service; or</span><br />
<span>(ii) manage the day-to-day operations of the broadcasting service; or are Zimbabwean citizens</span></p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it, YouTube does not qualify.</p>
<h3>Webcasting?</h3>
<p>As far as all I know, webcasting is just an uncool name for live streaming. So uhmm you can&#8217;t live stream without a license from BAZ? How is this law even enforceable? If I live stream on Facebook is it Facebook that&#8217;s breaking the law or it&#8217;s me?</p>
<h3>The law is skewed against citizens in favour of multinationals</h3>
<p>If no one ever raised a finger to question YouTube&#8217;s lack of license and Facebook, why did Kwese have to go through hoops? YouTube and Facebook are in a worse place because they can&#8217;t ever fulfill the demands of being Zimbabwean but<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/10/kwese-tv-is-not-a-zimbabwean-company/"> Kwese could or maybe not, whatever</a>.</p>
<p>My point is BAZ is bullying and raising barriers to local businesses and startups just by merely inviting applications for licensing of stuff that doesn&#8217;t make sense to license. As<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/zimbabwe-government-please-read-this-before-you-think-of-following-tanzania-and-uganda-in-censoring-online-news/"> I argued before</a>, licensing internet business does not help the government in any way, it just strengthens the global giants and kills local startups.</p>
<p>Even if Facebook qualified for the license and they were made to apply for it, they can do it easily but startups cannot. Here&#8217;s how much the license costs (as the law states):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>15. Video on Demand</strong><br />
<span>(a)Application fee initial US$2500 (non-refundable)</span><br />
<span>(b)Basic Licence Fee for three years US$20 000 per annum plus regulatory fees amounting to 2% monthly subscription turn over or deemed turnover</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh how I wish I were kidding!</p>
<p>Like one of the readers who commented the last time I touched on this subject:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>So Olinda and Stunner will need $6000 licenses for them live stream their fights?</span></p></blockquote>
<p>No, they would need $2 500 each upfornt then $20 000 per year each and of course 2% of subscriptions&#8230; Does BAZ expect Netflix to part with 2% of their subscription fees? Is Kwese gonna be paying that tribute?</p>
<h3>Disruption is coming</h3>
<p>As Lance Mambondiyani, the CEO of Steward Bank said at one of our events last year, &#8220;Any business or industry protected by legislation is ripe for disruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is very true. Media behemoths like DSTV are largely protected by licenses issued out by bureaucratic government agents. This can weaken them and blind them to changes happening around them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/05/the-brand-new-and-cheaper-h-metro-reveals-the-business-model-crisis-of-the-media-business/">media industry has a business model crisis right now</a> because it was protected by huge barriers to entry due to licensing issues and expensive equipment etc. Now technology has lowered cost of of equipment (a smartphone can be all the equipment one needs) and technology is making the licensing laws sound like bad jokes. Media businesses from always must beware.</p>

POS machines increased from 56 000 to 70000.</p>
<p>The drive to have 100 000 devices hinges on the government’s objective to increase <a href="http://rbz.co.zw/assets/zimbabwe-national-financial-inclusion-strategy-2016---2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial inclusion by having a cashless society.</a></p>
<p>The cash shortages have forced people to spend hours at banks queuing for money and several small businesses across urban areas are still requesting the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to increase the number of POS devices so that they do not lose business.</p>
<p>RBZ governor, <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/John_Mangudya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Mangudya</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are very happy with the phenomenal increase of the POS machines to 70 000 to date from around 56 000 at year end last year…. We are on course to obliterating our 2020 POS machines target of around 100 000 given the increased uptake of transacting machines by retailers and individual dealers</p></blockquote>
<p>Steward bank has been known to be the leading bank in offering POS machines so we expect that its share of POS devices has grown even more as a result of the introduction of their <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/steward-bank-launches-kwenga-portable-pos-machine-masses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portable POS device, Kwenga last year.</a></p>
<p>Anyway, the increase of POS devices is good news to RBZ because its goal to have <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2017/08/open-pos-machines-procurement-private-players-czr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 000 devices may come sooner before 2020</a>. RBZ thinks that if this feat it is achieved, <a href="http://www.thebusinessconnect.co.zw/govt-suspends-duty-on-pos-machines-move-meant-to-promote-use-of-plastic-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cash shortages would vanish and there will be ease in doing business in Zimbabwe.</a> But it&#8217;s not the cash crisis nor is the shortage of POS devices that has been making it hard to do business, it&#8217;s just a matter of <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/12/government-amend-indegenisation-act-removing-51-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad economic policies.</a></p>
<p>Currently, over 95 percent of retail transactions are being conducted electronically as the nation seeks to <a href="http://www.thebusinessconnect.co.zw/govt-suspends-duty-on-pos-machines-move-meant-to-promote-use-of-plastic-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sidestep the biting of physical cash shortages in the economy.</a> And this 95 percent has helped to carry out 368 million transactions. The governor went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the 371 million transactions carried out in the first quarter of 2018, 368 million transactions were POS and mobile payment transactions…. This indicates that 95 percent of our traders have now embraced plastic money, which is what we wanted when we launched this initiative</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year, the RBZ went as far as to <a href="http://www.chronicle.co.zw/rbz-still-wants-rtgs-pos-charges-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cap transaction costs on POS devices at 10c for purchases below $10</a> so as to increase the use of POS devices. So this decrease in charges is, in turn, increasing the use of POS devices and their demand as well.</p>
<p>In this particular sphere, RBZ is doing a great job. Kudos to you. Still, it should not neglect to fix the cash shortages because there are some transactions that need cash only such has commuting with a<a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Kombi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> kombi.</a> People are obtaining cash for these cash-only transactions by paying a<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/when-confronted-about-the-rampant-illegal-cash-sales-in-zimbabwe-this-is-what-the-minister-had-to-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> premium to &#8220;money changers&#8221;.</a> At the end of the day, the benefits of increasing the number of POS devices would be somewhat offset by the cost of accessing cash for cash-only transactions.</p>

Unfortunately, there was a flight delay and this has delayed the conference slightly.</p>
<p>Those in-the-know were aware of the fact that it was supposed to start at 2PM but we are past that and there has been no action. As mentioned before there was a delay with one of the flights that was supposed to come with some of the speakers so not much can be done about that.</p>
<p>We are not sure when exactly things are kicking off but if you are waiting for the event it would be wise to turn on notifications from our site in your browser as we will be live streaming the event once it&#8217;s underway.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Over the past two decades, a number of African economies have shown remarkable growth – with several African corporates establishing a formidable presence in the global arena. Alongside this growth, the continent has become a veritable hotbed of innovation, fuelled by an entrepreneurial spirit that has seen start-ups (many in the mobile and telecoms space) flourish. Arguably, however, Africa’s potential for growth – and its ability to produce sustainable, global businesses – remains inhibited by fragmentation. </span></p>
<p><span>Across the continent, and indeed in many other developing regions, disconnected economies are building products and services in silos. There is little to no overlap between emerging and established players; entrepreneurs lack access to valuable IP and market knowledge; funding is difficult and hard to come by and new businesses have to shoulder staggering operating costs and regulatory burdens. No wonder then, that too many promising start-ups and innovative concepts fail to scale and achieve any clout in their markets! </span></p>
<p><span>In a recent interview with the </span><em>Financial Times</em><span>, Wari money transfer chief executive Kabirou Mbodje noted that without better integration, African markets cannot have any major impact or influence in the global sphere. </span></p>
<p><span>“Africa is 54 countries. We’re talking about a billion people, a huge continent, 30 currencies. Why it is not prosperous is because we’re not integrated,” he stated. “We are small countries with no effect on a global scale [ . . .] If we don’t aggregate those markets together, we will not have leverage.”</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed, this lack of integration is hampering otherwise promising areas of growth and innovation. Within the fast-growing digital payments sector, for example, a high level of fragmentation raises operating costs and creates inefficiencies in the system. </span></p>

In fact, Africa is a maze of more than 276 mobile wallets, more than 500 banks, and 12 card networks in 54 countries…. This forces merchants to integrate with multiple payment service providers (PSPs) and banks to accept payments across the board, which is too expensive for all but the largest businesses. Even then, transactions can take days to clear, and merchants incur fees accepting payments or when withdrawing or transferring money. This encourages them to default to cash.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why ‘Benchmarkable’ Partnerships Are Key</strong></em></p>
<p><span>Looking ahead, the most efficient way to tackle the challenge of fragmentation is through partnerships – and more specifically, through leveraging the corporate and network expertise that comes alongside investment. </span></p>
<p><span>On the one hand, we have entrepreneurs and start-ups that are buoyed by venture capital funding and angel investors. This is an eco-system that is designed to manage and indeed, flourish, in the face of risk. In parallel, we are increasingly seeing corporate intrapreneurship – whereby corporates create teams or appoint ‘intrapreneurs’ to develop new businesses that operate outside of the mothership. </span></p>
<p><span>Arguably, there is a massive opportunity that lies in the space between the free-flying entrepreneurs (and their VC funders) and the more grounded corporate players. By establishing partnerships or some kind of operational relationship between the two, entrepreneurs can overcome the fragmentation issue by gaining access to established systems, processes and revenue streams &#8211; while corporates can leverage the innovation, agility and niche market expertise associated with VC-backed entrepreneurship. Such partnerships will enable promising new businesses to gain the operational reach that is so badly needed, at manageable cost, while simultaneously boosting corporate growth and investment. </span></p>
<p><span>As we have seen in Silicon Valley, such an ecosystem requires the development of a common language, a set of </span><a href="http://prco.mail.pr.co/c/eJwdjtuKxCAQRL8mPob2rg8-ZGD2NxbjZSObaIgOw87XrwYaqjh0V_Wrhus7ecMwYRp5s-pV2YjCYdM-uGBKUg5oMwJ7rTihVHhgZKWO-hhBaws-KhIicuU4bf4bV0QKyTvIzbp2xyipKUXO9pX0kwfiQgOgZAhgBRwoBqawmPEsBGGPx8KfC-YcCJ0YjG_m85pdQZfJ4V07a8Ftn3R0Nn_eqJnzCrXuqbbbF_9yLZWMbuyLG5VYcA0S7WZr7awTXSby1YcD9JRuflOtXf4BzL1UIg" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://prco.mail.pr.co/c/eJwdjtuKxCAQRL8mPob2rg8-ZGD2NxbjZSObaIgOw87XrwYaqjh0V_Wrhus7ecMwYRp5s-pV2YjCYdM-uGBKUg5oMwJ7rTihVHhgZKWO-hhBaws-KhIicuU4bf4bV0QKyTvIzbp2xyipKUXO9pX0kwfiQgOgZAhgBRwoBqawmPEsBGGPx8KfC-YcCJ0YjG_m85pdQZfJ4V07a8Ftn3R0Nn_eqJnzCrXuqbbbF_9yLZWMbuyLG5VYcA0S7WZr7awTXSby1YcD9JRuflOtXf4BzL1UIg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525430903974000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFOXAPgT8in3hq4mXB_IpMi-dwWrg" rel="noopener">established rules or norms,</a><span> and ways to benchmark the deal-making process. Just as Silicon Valley players have developed their own lexicon around debt and equity, for example, entrepreneurs, VCs and corporates need to establish their own glossary for dealmaking and partnerships going forward. </span></p>
<p><span>Critically, such partnerships should establish benchmarks for success from the very beginning – so that future deals have a strong point of reference and can be understood in the broader context. </span></p>

Not only was Zuckerberg sharing new features from the Facebook platform, but he also gave us glimpses into what we can expect from companies that exist under the Facebook umbrella, like Instagram.</p>
<p>Facebook announced that it is bringing group <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17306170/instagram-video-calls-explore-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video chats to both Instagram.</a></p>
<p>Instagram Direct messaging is popular but lacked video chat. So now Instagram is launch video chat. This feature is currently in a testing phase and will roll out globally in the coming months. Instagram’s official announcement noted that <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/05/01/new-ways-to-share-and-connect-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 million users use the Live feature every day, and as such, it saw a reason to launch a video calling feature.</a></p>

<p>Instagram is taking a cue from WhatsApp, another Facebook subsidiary which introduced video calls over a year ago. But it hasn&#8217;t yet managed to introduce <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/10/group-voice-calls-coming-whatsapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group calls since it promised the feature to users last year.</a></p>
<h4>This is how it will work</h4>
<p>Users will be able to call one-on-one or join small groups. You can launch a video call just by tapping the new camera icon on the top of a thread. Video calls can be minimized, too, users can keep browsing Instagram or chatting with others while in the video call.</p>
<p>This will work with both individual contacts as well as with ‘small’ groups. Facebook didn’t specify exactly how many users will be supported per call, but from the previews we’ve seen, it looks like you’ll be limited to four people at a time. This feature is currently being tested and will roll out globally in the next few weeks.</p>
<h4>No bullies</h4>
<p>Taking a strong stance on bullying,<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308012/instagram-offensive-comment-filtering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram is adding a filter for offensive comments.</a> If the comments have threatening remarks, Instagram will remove them. The feature is currently being rolled out and will be set to ‘On’ by default. However, users can head over to &#8216;Settings&#8217; and then go to &#8216;Comments&#8217; and switch &#8216;Automatic Filter&#8217; &#8216;Off&#8217;.</p>
<p><span>For now, the new anti-bullying filter is only launching for English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, German, Russian, French, Japanese, and Mandarin comments, and Instagram plans to offer it in other languages in the future, too.</span></p>
<p>Video calls combined with anti-bullying features, Instagram could become a safer and fun place for teens to hang out, which is just what Facebook wants to defeat Snapchat.</p>

Yes, you heard it right, three broadcasting licenses. The three licenses are for Web Casting, Video On Demand and Content Distribution.</p>
<p>The content distribution license is the one that Econet Media desperately needed as it is the one that enables Kwese to operate without wrangling with BAZ. You most probably remember that when Kwese initially entered Zimbabwe, it partnered <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/08/dr-dish-brings-kwese-tv-zimbabwe-press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dish</a> which had a license for content distribution.</p>
<p>Barely a day after Econet Wireless Zimbabwe announced that customers can now subscribe to the new Kwese TV service, the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/08/kwese-tv-not-licensed-says-broadcasting-authority-zimbabwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) released a statement saying that Kwese TV is not yet licensed</a> to operate in the country. BAZ’s pretext was that Dr. Dish’s license was canceled when the company initially attempted DTH pay-TV some years ago.</p>
<p>This then started a series of court battles and the halting of kwese to broadcast and sell their decoders.</p>
<h4>The long battle starts</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/08/exclusive-kwese-tv-demands-reversal-license-cancellation-government-threatens-legal-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr dish issued an ultimatum to BAZ</a> demandinding that it retracts the cancellation of its license or else face legal action. It also threatened to sue BAZ CEO, Mr. Obert Muganyura, in his personal capacity, for any loss in revenue that they would suffer due to what they referred to as an “illegal decision”.</p>
<p>Unswayed by the threats, BAZ ignored Dr. Dish’s threats. Dr dish finally took the case before the high court represented by the Econet associated lawayer, Tawanda Nyambirai. Dr. Dish pretext for the labeling BAZ’s decision was that the CEO of BAZ did not have the authority to cancel their license as it was a Board’s decision. But back then BAZ had no Board and it still doesn’t have a board as of today.</p>
<p>Consequently, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/high-court-reserves-judgement-urgency-kwese-tv-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dish won the court case</a> and Kwese resumed broadcasting and selling its decoders.</p>
<p>A week later,<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/baz-taking-kwese-back-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> BAZ was at it again</a> when it challenged the High Court’s ruling arguing that the High Court had no jurisdiction to preside over the Kwesé TV case. And also that the High Court’s decision to allow Econet media to operate was improper since there was no amendment to Dr. Dish’s license to broadcast.</p>
<p>After seeing that BAZ was unrelenting and the case could take forever to be resolved,<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/dr-dish-baz-kwese-tv-licence-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Kwesé TV sought a High Court permission to continue operating despite the BAZ appeal.</a></p>
<p>Again, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/kwese-tv-stops-operations-due-baz-appeal-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kwese suspended its operations after Dr Dish’s license was cancelled.</a> But a few weeks later <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/kwese-back-high-court-says-can-continue-selling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kwese was told to resume operations again until the Supreme Court decided.</a></p>
<h4>Then something shocking happened.</h4>
<p>Kwese (Econet Media)<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/kwese-terminated-dr-dich-contract-because-mlotshwa-mnangagwa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> terminated their contract with Dr. Dish,</a> the company which had a broadcasting licence that Kwese was using to broadcast in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The termination happened most likely because<a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Gerald_Mlotshwa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Gerald Mlotshwa</a>, a guy married to President Mnangagwa’s daughter had acquired a controling stake in Dr Dish. The problem was Mlotshwa also has 40% stake in Telecel which is a competitor to Econet Wireless Zimbabwe. (Mlotshwa&#8217;s claim on Telecel is now under challenge too). This arrangement was not appealing to Econet so it decided to sever the ties.</p>
<p>This could be what <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/econet-media-kwese-applies-broadcasting-services-licences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> motivated them to apply for three broadcasting licenses</a> which they have been eventually granted. This means they don&#8217;t need to rely on anyone just for a license anymore.</p>
<h4>But something is fishy here.</h4>
<p>When Kwese severed ties with Dr. Dish, whose license they were using to broadcast doesn&#8217;t that mean they were now operating illegally till now?</p>
<p>Let’s look at it from another perspective. Who licensed Kwese when BAZ doesn’t’ have a Board which is responsible for the granting of broadcasting licenses? We will relook at the Broadcasting Act to understand more clearly how these things work.</p>
<p>The whole argument that Dr Dish and Kwese took to the High Court in the first place was that BAZ could not legally revoke or grant license without a board. What&#8217;s changed now? We are obviously not legal minds so we might have missed something, hope we will get legal comment on this soon.</p>
<p>Anyway, congratulations to Kwese.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s their notice to customers:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Discontinuation of acceptance of manual RTGS and Internal Funds Transfers</strong></p>
<p>CBZ Bank would like to advise its valued clients and all stakeholders that with effect from the 1st of June 2018, all branches will no longer be processing manual/paper RIGS and Internal Transfer requests. All clients will be able to perform the transactions via CBZ Touch, CBZ Internet Banking and Paynet conveniently anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>We therefore urge all clients to ensure that they have registered on CBZ Touch, CBZ Internet Banking or Paynet platforms by the 31st of May 2018. For more information get In touch with your Relationship Managers or visit any CBZ Bank Branch. Alternatively, call the CBZ Contact Centre via toll free line 460/461 or general line 08677004050.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Zimbabwe online?</h3>
<p>When this trend of banks going paperless started <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/zb-bank-discontinues-manual-rtgs-goes-exclusive-with-internet-banking/">we asked if this would not adversely affect customers</a> who do not have internet access particularly customers in the rural areas. It looks like our fears were needless, a few other banks have since gone paperless too and we haven&#8217;t heard any outcry from any inconvenienced customers.</p>
<h3>Lack of financial inclusion could be reason</h3>
<p>That there were no rural customers affected by migration of banks to online channels for transactions may mean there were not so many rural customers in the first place. This is actually very true. How many rural bank branches are available? Very few.</p>
<p>The poor penetration of banks in rural areas where more than 60% of the population resides is not a very good picture. However, this is not because banks are evil, far from it. The volume and values of transactions in rural areas would not sustain branches there.</p>
<p>Economic activity is not only low and seasonal in rural areas but it is distributed very sparsely.</p>
<h3>Moving to online could mean more inclusion actually</h3>
<p>Our previous assumption that going online could make financial services more exclusive to city and town folks was actually wrong. There was never going to be a business case that would support the building o f banking halls in rural and farming communities but digital platforms can be accessed from these areas.</p>
<p>Going exclusively online with stuff like RTGS processing could help banks to think digitally first which will help them solve the issue of low financial inclusion more effectively without strict and limiting definitions of what a bank should look like.</p>
<p>Just by increasing digital literacy in marginalised and far flung communities, financial inclusion will also be increased if banking is digitised as it is becoming. Digital banking hubs can be set up by the banks individually or to make things more efficient by the RBZ or a company like Zimswitch in these areas to cater for homes where there is no smartphone or internet access. This would be cheaper than setting up branches.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is already cashless for all intents and purposes, the processing of transactions might as well be</p>

<p>The bank’s notice read:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We would like to advise our valued customers that the Society has, with immediate effect made changes to DSTV payments as follows: </em><br />
<em>1. DSTV payment services will be available to all CABS customers. </em><br />
<em>2. Customers will have to bring USD cash to access the service. </em><br />
<em>3. The DSTV commission per transaction has been changed to $5-00. </em><br />
<em>4. DSTV payment facility will no longer be available on Mobile banking, Internet Banking and ATM delivery channels. </em><br />
<em>5. DSTV payment services will be available at all branches.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>CABS account holders were one of the remaining banks that still offered customers the benefit of using their bond notes in their bank accounts to make DSTV payments.

Ever since the advent of technology, the dependency on web-based information has multiplied at a phenomenal rate to an extent that life in the 21st century comes to a standstill without the internet. More so, it has made the spread of information and news very quick such that it is creating a problem where users create <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/1888266/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake news</a> and spread it on the internet.</p>
<p>Fake news on Google and social media have raised the ire of <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Christopher_Mutsvangwa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Special Advisor to the President, Chris Mutsvangwa</a> during the <span>a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WPFDZim2018?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Press Freedom Day Zimbabwe</a> breakfast meeting today</span>. Mutsvangwa who claims to be the father of the internet and the digital age in Zimbabwe surprised the audience when he demanded that the Google Zimbabwe Editor is biased against Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Seriously??? Does Google have an editor or its just autonomous algorithms?</p>
<p>For someone who considers himself to be a techie, to hear this is shocking.<br />
He said that he wants to know the editor of Google in Zimbabwe as he was not impressed with the way Google presents news on Zimbabwe.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘The way Google presents information on Zimbabwean issues is questionable. Who manages Google?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Special adviser went on to say that social media needs to be regulated to stem fake news as it posed to be a danger to the free press.</p>
<blockquote><p>The free press is in danger because you are now competing with what is fake news which is why regulation on social media is needed says</p></blockquote>
<p>He issued a stern warning to journalists asking them to guard against fake news otherwise they will write themselves into poverty.</p>
<h4>Is it even possible to for Zimbabwe to regulate Social Media?</h4>
<p>But the regulation of fake news is hard for a country that is not technologically sophisticated like Zimbabwe as previously discussed <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/with-elections-on-the-horizon-watch-out-for-the-fake-news-storm-that-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this article</a> for the mere reason that it’s almost impossible to know where the fake news originates from. Chris Mutsvangwa may be taking a cue from<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/whatsappfacebookinstagram-and-twitter-usage-will-soon-be-taxed-in-uganda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Uganda which is considering taxing social media.</a> So in light of this, by taxing social media companies, the government will effectively be able to penalize them if fake news was spread on the platform.</p>
<h4>Why this sudden call to regulate social media?</h4>
<p>Mr. Mutsvangwa knows the power of social media with respect to the part social played in making in the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/11/not-tech-business-mugabe-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transition of power late last year.</a> He stated that social media played a crucial role in bringing about change during<a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Operation_Restore_Legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> “Operation Restore Legacy”.</a></p>
<p>In the same vein, he fears the upcoming elections results can be swayed against his party if the fake news is not curbed. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/with-elections-on-the-horizon-watch-out-for-the-fake-news-storm-that-is-coming/">Elections results in Sierra Leon</a> were alleged to have been influenced by fake news that circulated on WhatsApp.</p>

The new H-Metro now costs 50c meaning a 50% slash in the price from the $1 it used to be.</p>
<p>This may be good news for those who are already customers of H-Metro but it signals bad news for the publication, the Zimpapers Group, print media and the media industry collectively. This decision shows how media is in crisis.</p>
<h3>New H-Metro?</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Zimpapers described their hyped new take on Zimbabwe&#8217;s leading tabloid:</p>
<blockquote><p>H-METRO better than ever!</p>
<p>Our content will be richer and meant to address all your concerns as our readers. For a whole year, we sat down with readers from all sectors of society noting their concerns and what they love about our paper.</p>
<p>Now, from tomorrow, 30 April 2018, we have a product that all our readers will be proud of. And they will be proud of the price too!</p>
<p>With better news, in-depth coverage of critical issues, matters of interest to both sexes, your hot gossip, and as usual the best of entertainment and sport coverage on society&#8217;s prominent people, the new look H-Metro comes at an unbelievable price of only 50 cents!</p>
<p>The biggest irony of this new look H-Metro is that disparity between the price and improved stories and design. We have the incredible combination of the best paper in the country having the best price.</p>
<p>Now all our readers can afford the paper and there is no need to borrow or share. We will also do our best to make language and content family friendly and there will be no reason not to get a copy.</p></blockquote>
<h3>The futility of lowering the price</h3>
<p>The number one instinct for a business in trouble is to lower the price. However, this is hardly the winning play and history proves it. The last thing you want to do when you are facing problems is to lower your margins (profitability) and your cashflow capacity (your business&#8217; lifeblood). Unfortunately almost every business under threat from competition or some other factor chooses to go down this path.</p>
<p>The alternative rarely explored by in trouble businesses is harder. The way out would be to review your business model and change. It requires bravery and feels more risky than to just lower your margin (by 50% in the case of H-Metro).</p>
<h3>The gap cannot be covered</h3>
<p>H-Metro cannot hope to double their sales in order to get as much sales revenue as they were getting. If they are hoping to get more than that for this to make sense, I will be brutal and tell them right now that it&#8217;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Another problem is that increasing sales revenue by increasing number of copies sold after a price reduction is near impossible because each additional copy sold has it&#8217;s own marginal cost. A 50% reduction in price therefore results in a more than 50% impact to their bottom line.</p>
<p>This is different for digital publications. The marginal cost is almost zero. It doesn&#8217;t cost Techzim anything extra really to have an extra reader. This difference is the biggest and underlying shift in most internet based business models.</p>
<h3>Maybe their target is advertiser money&#8230;</h3>
<p>I know clever readers were already screaming that I don&#8217;t realise that H-Metro is going for advertiser money after all this is the predominant business model in media and news: money comes from advertising.</p>
<p>How many more readers does H-Metro need to gain for them to be able to increase their advertising rates or attract new advertisers or both?</p>
<h3>The numbers won&#8217;t come</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the readership numbers they need to make such changes to their advertiser revenue will not be achieved. Their problem is not necessarily that H-Metro was too expensive at a dollar (it might have been). Their biggest problem is that H-Metro content is readily and more efficiently supplied by WhatsApp.</p>
<p>H-Metro stormed Zimbabwe when it was launched in September 2009 and became very topical and popular because it exposed us all to the cheesiest and juciest gossip out there. Cheating husbands exposed, witchcraft accusations&#8230; all these tickled the gossip itchy ears of Zimbabweans (mostly Harare folks).</p>
<p>9 years later: by the time it comes out in H-Metro you have already seen it on WhatsApp 5 times yesterday. If for some reason there&#8217;s a fresh story that never got viral on social media but appears in H-Metro, you know you&#8217;re not gonna miss out because your cousin and ten other people in as many groups will share it with you on WhatsApp before the newspaper boy in your area has set up their stall.</p>
<p>Why on earth would you buy the paper now, even if it&#8217;s 50c? You already have a WhatsApp bundle that gives you access to all this content and more for just $1 for the whole week!</p>
<h3>The content doesn&#8217;t help</h3>
<p>Part of the changes to H-Metro are changes in content. This confirms that they may be going for advertiser dollars. The very content that made and still makes H-Metro popular is content that advertisers are not too eager to put their brand against.</p>
<p>This presents a vicious cycle: if they change their content they may lose their readers which makes them unimportant to advertisers and if they don&#8217;t change their content they may retain readers but remain toxic to advertisers at least those who would pay meaningfully. H-Metro is attempting to have their cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what they say about their content:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will also do our best to make the language and content family friendly&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Firstly, doing their best doesn&#8217;t mean anything. Secondly, once they clean up their content they will lose their audience: people already have other options for serious news. This may be the reason why the price is dropping, to retain readers who may otherwise want to leave due to change in content. Bad place to be.</p>
<h3>Quality content costs more</h3>
<p>To move away from the gossipy tabloid stuff to whatever they are calling family friendly content it will cost them more. Good journalists have to be paid more and have to be given more time to work on stories. This then makes the decision to cut the price by 50% an even more terrible decision.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s not too late for digital</h3>
<p>H-Metro resisted online. At some point they were so poor with their Facebook page that<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2012/02/two-h-metro-facebook-pages-the-more-popular-one-is-fake/"> someone created a fake one and it got to be more popular than the legit one</a>. H-Metro<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2012/03/h-metro-is-off-facebook/"> quit Facebook at that time because they couldn&#8217;t compete with the fake account</a>. When online tabloids started stealing content from H-Metro and pasting it online their response was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Instead of making sure they were always first with their own content online, they started delaying publishing stories online. Further<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/06/h-metro-resolves-to-protecting-content-by-converting-text-to-images-this-is-why-it-wont-work/"> they started uploading stories as images and not text</a>. Unfortunately Google crawlers can&#8217;t read images hence the pages would not be indexed properly to rank on search.</p>
<p>The content stealers were actually empowered by that move: they simply bought the H-Metro and typed in the stories themselves unto their own platforms. As far as search engines were concerned: the pirates were the owners of the content because the actual owner was not online.</p>
<p>All they need to do is just decide to make H-Metro a strictly online publication optimised for that. They already have a strong brand and resources to be big online. Tabloid content thrives online not in newspaper form.</p>
<p>Yes digital business models for media are still not solved but they will be. I hope H-Metro will embrace digital and be part of those that will solve the sticky business model question.</p>

<p>Stanbic’s move is partly a response to the concerns that exporters expressed<a href="http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/news/exports-up-36-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> earlier this year in February concerning their struggle to access export facilities and which in turn is strangling the growth of their exports.</a> Stanbic head of personal and business banking, Patson Mahachi said:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few players in industries such as horticulture, hides and skin exporters closed shop as they struggled to acquire the required capital to fund their ventures, yet there is a great market out there. Exporters are free to come and engage us for potential support as we can do more for this niche sector.</p></blockquote>
<h4>How will Stanbic help?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/04/stanbic-boosts-exporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Under the facility</a>, Stanbic will advance over 60% working capital to exporters who have been proven as credit worthy on the back of confirmed export invoices for the purpose of supporting immediate working capital requirements pending receipt of proceeds. Companies who are into exports such as horticulture, floriculture, citrus, macadamia nuts and oils, hides and skins, manufacturers and services among other sectors can access the facility.</p>
<p>RBZ has in the past come up with measures to stimulate exports such as the enhanced export incentive scheme for horticulture but unidentified banks are alleged to be reluctant to disburse the funds.</p>
<p>The 5% percent export incentive scheme introduced in 2016 for exporters has since been increased to 12.5 percent for top Zimbabwe exporters to increase exports.</p>
<p><span>Funded through bond notes, the export incentives were introduced as a way to boost foreign exchange generation in the economy. But no tangible result of an increase in foreign currency in Zimbabwe has been realized since the export incentive was introduced as the cash and foreign currency shortages are continuously becoming worse.</span></p>

<h3><strong>How will this work?</strong></h3>
<p>Well, Zuckerburg took a veiled shot at <a href="https://tinder.com/">Tinder</a> and similar dating services which are aimed at more casual hook-ups as he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is going to be for building real, long-term relationships — not just hook-ups</p></blockquote>
<p>The feature will require users to opt-in and will match users with people who are not their friends already.</p>
<p>The new dating feature links to events and groups on the larger platform, allowing users with dating profiles to connect via shared interests or commonly attended events.</p>
<p>Users of this feature will also be able to send messages which are not linked to their Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>There was no timeline on when this feature can be expected but this is definitely one of the biggest additions to Facebook and it will be very interesting to see how they execute this.</p>
<h3><strong>How will this be received in Zim?</strong></h3>
<p>In America, dating services such as Tinder and the hook-up culture is not viewed as taboo so these apps can easily gain popularity whereas in Zimbabwe people are a bit more cautious about relationships and this means engagement of such apps is usually much lower.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tinder may have been suffering because it’s not really popular here and maybe this new feature on Facebook will encourage wider adoption of dating services in Zimbabwe and make them more acceptable. I don’t think this will be the case but I may be wrong… Facebook bundles could make this more accessible to Zimbabweans than the current dating applications out there.</p>
<h3><strong>Other new features coming to Facebook…</strong></h3>
<p>This conference comes shortly after Facebook’s Cambridge-Analytica related struggles and this unveiling of new features may help their case as these may take user’s minds from privacy concerns to excitement for the new stuff coming their way.</p>
<h4><strong>A response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal?</strong></h4>
<p>Firstly, FB is introducing a feature which seems a direct response to appease those who were not happy about the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/mark-zuckerberg-updates-facebook-users-on-steps-theyve-taken-to-ensure-they-never-encounter-similar-data-breaches/">Cambridge Analytica situation</a>. With the new feature, users will be able to track which apps and websites you interact with. You will also be able to clear this information from your account making it harder for your data to be used for sinister purposes.</p>
<p>This feature won’t be coming soon enough to end your privacy fears it seems. The feature was said to be a few months away. This is probably because the feature was not already in development but was actually forced onto the agenda because of their recent struggles.</p>
<h4><strong>Messenger getting a new lick of paint</strong></h4>
<p>FB Messenger service will be getting a redesign with the goal of simplifying the experience once again. Zuckerberg said:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you’re messaging, you really want a simple and fast experience. We’re taking this moment to completely redesign Messenger to focus on these ideas.</p></blockquote>
<p>The app is said to be coming very soon, so if you’re a user of Messenger keep an eye out for that.</p>
<h4><strong>AR Studio getting a revamp as well</strong></h4>
<p>The social media giant’s augmented reality app is making it easier to create AR content. AR Studio is getting new tracking capabilities; i.e. target tracking (objects), face tracking, hand tracking and body tracking.</p>
<p>Facebook will also now allow users to share their AR creations to Messenger, Instagram and Facebook Lite. The feature, like many other introduced today, has no timeline but is already in beta so you can expect it sooner than later.</p>
<p>What do you think about the new features coming to Facebook? Particularly the dating feature. Do you think this will hit the ground running in Zimbabwe or will people steer clear on this one? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments below!</p>

<p>Facebook is developing a device that sends messages to your skin so that users can stay connected even when their smartphones, tablets or laptops are out of reach. It means Facebook fans will never miss a message or alert even at times when they can’t check a phone, such as during a meeting or even in church.</p>
<p>The device, called a<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/6168615/facebook-send-messages-skin-device-alerts-meetings/"> transcutaneous language communication (TLC) system</a>, could also be used when running, driving or even carrying shopping bags in both hands. The researchers used the arm as the preferred part of body to put the device because the arm is said to have higher sensitivity than most body parts. The researchers said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We use the forearm as the medium because it has a better tactile sensitivity than most body parts, less likely to disrupt daily activity compared to the hand, and more socially acceptable than the forehead or feet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the system could be adapted for use by people with disabilities. The went on to say that:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the blind, fingers can be freed to type while receiving messages through the arm…..For people with impaired hearing, their visual sense will no longer be overwhelmed by sign language and other visual information…..Blind-deaf people can do speechreading independently and easily without the presence of a speaker and placing their hand on the speaker&#8217;s face.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this device could provide another avenue for corporations to invade private lives and exploit personal data. The<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/mark-zuckerberg-updates-facebook-users-on-steps-theyve-taken-to-ensure-they-never-encounter-similar-data-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ongoing scandal Facebook is involved in</a> provides an insight into how companies can abuse people’s data.</p>

The fact that I only have to say the Econet story and most readers will understand immediately what I mean shows just how powerful it is. Every David and Goliath story is like this: engaging, inspirational, moving.</p>
<p>Now it appears we didn&#8217;t know the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/10/strive-masiyiwas-detailed-story-fighting-corruption-africa-important/">full story</a> and we still don&#8217;t. Apparently the bullying of Econet by the government of Zimbabwe (let&#8217;s say by the government of Robert Mugabe) did not end when Econet got their license to operate just before the turn of the millennium. Strive Masiyiwa blogged about an incident that happened several years after that time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reflection: A painful moment remembered</p>
<p>__And neighbourly kindness remembered, too.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe’s night is over and we must work together now to bring in the dawn. We must work hard to turn away from (and learn from) the pages of our pained past. This includes talking about it, because this is part of the healing process…</p>
<p>I was on my way to Singapore several years ago where some investors had promised me a huge investment fund for Africa. I was excited! This was my big break.</p>
<p>My flight connection from South Africa where I lived, was through Bangkok and as I ran to the gate, my phone started to ring. It was my brother-in-law who worked for the intelligence service in Zimbabwe. I could hear my cousin sister sobbing in the background.</p>
<p><strong>“They are going to arrest all your directors and senior management tonight.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Why?!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“It is meant to force them all to resign so your company can collapse.”</strong></p>
<p>I could not turn back because the door of the plane had closed. I switched off my phone and sat quietly. I did not eat or drink water the entire flight. It was time to pray and fast.</p>
<p>When we landed in Singapore, I called my brother-in-law. He confirmed that the arrests had been effected. Directors and executives (including CEO Douglas Mboweni) of the largest public company on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange had all been away to the maximum security prison in leg irons. Even retired former directors had been arrested.</p>
<p>I tried calling our leading lawyer. He, too, had been arrested. My brother-in-law suggested I not go to South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>“There is a team there who have been sent to abduct you,” he warned. “They will say you came back to the country by yourself.”</strong></p>
<p>My cousin sister grabbed the phone from him and begged me: <strong>“Please do as he says!”</strong></p>
<p>I cancelled my meetings with investors. I sat in my hotel room making calls. I found Beatrice Mtetwa, a fearless human rights lawyer. She had already began to work on the case. They would not tell her what the issue was.</p>
<p>There would be no bail. They were held in a section of the prison which houses death row inmates. Years later, one of my executives was still traumatized by the wailings and lamentations of those on death row. (Like the new President of Zimbabwe, I’m a fierce opponent of the death penalty, and I hope he will push for its repeal in Zimbabwe, and anywhere else in Africa).</p>
<p>No one seemed to care about the fact that this was a company majority-owned by tens of thousands of ordinary people directly, and through their pension funds. At the time, I personally owned less than 40% of the company. Had it collapsed, anyone who held a pension plan or life policy would have been affected, including public sector workers.</p>
<p>Our lawyer finally managed to get a hearing for them after more than a week. They came to the court dressed as convicts with leg irons. I was sent TV footage of it. I continued my prayers. They were sent back to the prison. There were no charges pressed against any of them for anything.</p>
<p>I reached out to the prayer network that had always stood with me within the country and around the world. We agreed to “pray and fast without ceasing until they were released.” During the day, I would be on the phone with Beatrice, then I would have a light meal and go to join my wife in prayer until the early hours of the morning. All in all, they were held for 16 days. Then I broke my fast and finally got some real sleep!</p>
<p>After they were released, my team went back to work as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>I flew first to England and then back to South Africa after getting security assurances from their government. (I’m grateful to the South African government even to this day for coming to my aid and protecting me and my family). When I finally met the entire team in South Africa, we agreed that as Christians we had a duty to forgive those who persecuted us, including the leader of the country.</p>
<p>With my team, we decided to redouble our efforts to help Zimbabwe through its dark night. This is just a “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to what we went through.</p>
<p>We forgave.</p>
<p>Wisdom (not fear) compelled me to develop business interests around the world, going even as far as New Zealand and South America.</p>
<p>Nigeria, Kenya, Lesotho, Botswana, Zambia, Burundi and Rwanda were some of the interests I developed during that time. All the leaders in these countries back then knew about my plight through their embassies, and went out of their way to make me welcome.</p>
<p>I appreciate it to this day. That is why I always stand so firmly with those countries, supporting them as though I am a citizen.</p>
<p>Although I never had a business in Senegal, then-President Wade and his foreign minister learnt about my plight, and even asked me to come and live there. I knew it was the grace of God that in the midst of such persecution, world leaders began to take notice of me.</p>
<p>President Wade and President Obasanjo were like fathers to me. Hey, I just hope I won’t have to watch Nigeria vs Senegal in the World Cup finals on Kwesé TV! (Actually, the perfect final for me is those two countries playing each other!)</p>
<p>We forgive always.</p>
<p>We love always.</p>
<p>Strive Masiyiwa</p></blockquote>
<p>This series of events had never been told before. It is quite interesting that the Econet directors chose to go back to work as if nothing had happened and never talked about this. That takes some character strength.</p>
<p>Since the story happened before Techzim&#8217;s time it is quite difficult to find it anywhere online. However, we did stumble upon<a href="https://www.insiderzim.com/mobile-phone-bosses-arrested-for-externalisation/"> some wikiliks details that confirm the incident</a> and place the arrests in 2004. Apparently the Econet directors were arrested together with several other business leaders including James Makamba who was at fellow MONO, Telecel.</p>
<p>Masiyiwa is right that these stories must be told. They remind us of a past we don&#8217;t want to see again. I hope he will share the other stuff he implied happened.</p>

The business helps you and I to navigate everyday life seamlessly through their payments integration platform.</p>
<h3>The Zimswitch Evolution</h3>
<p>One thing they have managed to do over the years has been to <a href="http://www.zimswitch.co.zw/2017/03/27/history-of-zimswitch-its-key-milestones-over-the-years/">evolve with the economy and every new reality in Zimbabwe</a>. When they launched in the mid nineties the service I was most aware of (maybe because I was a kid then) was that they allowed one to withdraw from any member bank&#8217;s ATM using any other member bank debit card.</p>
<p>As the use of debit cards grew I started associating Zimswitch more with point of sale swiping. Their infrastructure made it possible for any debit card in Zimbabwe really to be used in any store in Zimbabwe regardless of the bank that issued the POS payment machine. It&#8217;s easy to take this integration for granted but imagine for a few seconds how grocery shopping would look like without Zimswitch especially now when<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/07/zimbabwe-ready-plastic-money-cash-crisis-solution-try-looking-pos-machine/"> cash is super rare</a>.</p>
<p>Cash problems in Zimbabwe actually brought to the fore the ability of Zimswitch to adapt, evolve and solve new problems. Zipit was introduced to facilitate more real time processing of transactions between banks. The service is more real time than the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system itself!</p>
<p>The problem with evolution is that by definition it is not noticeable. You only see how things have changed when you look in the rear view mirror. This is definitely the case when you trace Zimswitch from the mid nineties up to now. As conditions changed, their offer changed and we never got to feel how much more adverse some of the stuff we&#8217;ve been through could have been.</p>
<h3>Payments Conference</h3>
<p>The Zimswitch backstory makes them qualified to convene a payments conference as they are doing in Victoria Falls from the 3rd to the 5th of May.</p>
<p>The event&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Sustaining digital payments in Zimbabwe and opening a gateway into SADC.&#8221; It will be interesting to know what conversations will be going on around sustaining digital payments in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The obvious one which I expected and was glad to find on the programme is interoperability. This is important if digital payments are going to go beyond where we are right now. Already Zimswitch provides an interoperable platform and API&#8217;s that other services can use to integrate Zimswitch services into their own.</p>
<p>Just a few banks in Zimbabwe are not available on Zimswitch. Two of the three MNO controlled mobile money services already have a relationship with Zimswitch and will be attending the conference.</p>
<h3>SADC</h3>
<p>Part of the theme talks of opening a gateway into SADC. That this is important is a no brainer really. Our individual economies in SADC are small and fregmented. The region gains much the more we integrate. The original objectives of SADC were economic more than political. Fighting apartheid in South Africa was predominantly going to be achieved through economic means. The region is thus more of an economic block than a political one especially after the fall of apartheid itself.</p>
<p>Making payments easy and seamless between member states is crucial if the potential economic activity across the block is to be realised. Technology innovation and creativity by organisations like Zimswitch within member states can and will open up the region for growth.</p>
<h3>Be Part Of The Zimswitch Payments Conference Through Techzim</h3>
<p>Techzim is proud to be live streaming the event so you can follow the conversations and even interact with the delegates there. We will have the live stream available here on our site and on our social media pages as well. We invite you to tune in and participate as much as the delegates there.</p>
<p>We mostly look forward to the participation of developers and tech entrepreneurs because the issue of payments is super important for this group of people.</p>

These policy updates are popping up because organizations are adopting a new European Union (EU) Directive called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that is set to change how business is done the world over.</p>
<p>Websites and Apps like WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat are already changing their T’s and C’s notifying users as they seek to comply with the GDPR directive. Before you see how these policy updates affect Zimbabwean companies, let&#8217;s see GDPR is all about?</p>
<h4>What is GDPR?</h4>
<p>GDPR is a regulation that requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. While GDPR is good news for the data privacy of individuals in the EU, investors may be irritated by these changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/whatsapp-updates-minimum-age-requirement-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp, for instance, has decided to cut off under-16s from its services</a> altogether and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/snap-to-change-how-snap-map-operates-in-europe-ahead-of-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapchat, another App with a youthful user base is following suit.</a> This significantly reduces the number of users on these platforms</p>
<h4>Who will GDPR specifically?</h4>
<p>Beyond Europe, GDPR will apply to any business where their data processing relates to the offering of goods and services to EU-based people or the monitoring of online behavior. Even if they do not have a business presence within the EU. Specific criteria for companies required to comply are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A presence in an EU country. </a></li>
<li>No presence in the EU, but it processes personal data of European residents.</li>
<li> More than 250 employees.</li>
<li> Fewer than 250 employees but its data-processing impacts the rights and freedoms of data subjects, is not occasional or includes certain types of sensitive personal data. That effectively means almost all companies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What constitutes personal data?</h4>
<p>Personal data is any information related to a natural person that can be used to directly or indirectly identify the person.</p>
<p>It can be anything from a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer IP address.</p>
<h4>What are the penalties for non-compliance?</h4>
<p>Organizations can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or €20 Million. This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements e.g.not having sufficient customer consent to process data.</p>
<h4>Why does GDPR even exist?</h4>
<p>In a nutshell, it exists because of public concern over privacy. Europe, in general, has long had more stringent rules around how companies use the personal data of its citizens.</p>
<h4>How will these privacy policy updates/GDPR affect Zimbabwean companies?</h4>
<p>Of course, an EU-based company or multinational corporation that does business in the EU is expected to comply with the GDPR. But what about Zimbabwean. companies that have no direct business operations in any one of the 28-member states of the European Union. Do they have anything to worry about?</p>
<p>Zimbabwean companies without a physical presence in an EU country collect most of the personal data belonging to EU data subjects over the Web.</p>
<p>Many websites in Zimbabwe collect this kind of data through newsletters and signing up can be affected by the GDPR directive.</p>
<p>Customer engagement will be hard under the GDPR directive. The conditions for obtaining consent are stricter as the individual must have the right to withdraw consent at any time.</p>
<p>This means you have to be able to prove that the individual agreed to a certain action, to receive a newsletter for instance.  This changes a lot of things for companies such as the way your sales teams prospect or the way that marketing activities are managed.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean-based hospitality, travel, banks and stoke brokers companies will certainly have to take a closer look at their online marketing practices. Also, companies with a strong Web presence like us Techzim should be paying attention and changing practices now.</p>

<p>You may have heard of the online multiplayer game Fortnite that has been making waves over the past couple of months. I play video games quite often but most of my experiences with gaming have been offline and the rare times I have been online it has been on mobile games so the experience was not really enjoyable. Fortnite changed all of that!</p>
<h4>What is this Fortnite about?</h4>
<p>Fortnite is an online shooter and its claim to fame has been through the Battle Royale mode. In this mode, 100 players are dropped onto an island and the last man standing on the island is the winner. It sounds simple enough and not really compelling but once you drop in with a friend you will get hooked pretty quickly.</p>
<h4>How my Fortnite adventure started</h4>
<p>A few weeks ago, one of my friends told me he had been playing it and because he has a Macbook Pro with specs similar to my computer, I thought I might as well try it out and see if all the hype was worth it and thus far, the experience I’ve had is great.</p>
<p>So, I downloaded the game (a mere 8GB and its FREE) and the setup was a breeze. A few minutes after installation I had paired up with my friend and we were blasting away. Granted, my friend and I are quite terrible, we have been dying a lot and our team has not been able to win since we started playing. Our best finish thus far has been a third-place finish but it wasn’t necessarily because we are skilled but more because we were just lucky.</p>
<p>If you are interested in gaming, I would highly recommend that you check this game out. Playing alone will be ok but if you can get to play with someone you know or at least someone in Zim will change that whole experience.</p>
<h4>Getting to play with people from other regions is great&#8230;</h4>
<p>My friend and I have played with guys from other parts of the world as well and that’s been a great experience. There’s a kid from Italy called Lorenzo who we’ve played with a couple of times and he’s provided us with some comic relief. The kid barely speaks English, but he keeps joining our team even though he doesn’t understand us at all. Even when we speak in Shona throughout sessions he’s just there waiting for battle. This kid is the true definition of a loyal soldier.</p>
<h4><strong>Data issues?</strong></h4>
<p>Ok, the biggest concern you probably have is how much data does the game consume? Well, over the past 3 weeks I’ve managed to squeeze in over 10 hours playing the game and I’ve only used 561MB. I’m not sure how that looks from where you are standing but from here that looks like a reasonable amount of data.</p>
<h4><strong>If any of you guys are already playing or looking to play… look for me</strong></h4>
<p>If you’re already playing Fortnite you can send me a request. My ID is FariM9 and who knows, if I get time we might just get in a match as one team. If you want to download Fortnite you can do so <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>A few of the guys at Techzim have also been playing PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds (AKA, PUBG) on mobile and they have been having a blast. PUBG has the same concept as Fortnite and the added benefit is that you get to play it on mobile as well. You can download that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.ig&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Asycuda system is used for online pre-clearance of goods, issuance of road access fees payment and processing of temporary import permits [TIPs] for vehicles. Zimra is in a hurry to complete the upgrading of Asycuda by the 1st of June this year.</p>
<p>While presenting Zimra’s first quarter results, Zimra board chairperson Willia Bontongwe said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The authority is currently in the process of upgrading the system to a higher version and to this end, three top-of-the-range servers have been acquired…..This should put an end to the systems crash experienced previously especially in December 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/02/finally-zimra-is-updating-system-after-losing-millions/">Zimra incurred a loss of at least 20 million</a> as a result of December&#8217;s breakdown and already this year there have been <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/zimra-system-in-beitbridge-goes-down-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two breakdowns.</a></p>
<p>The system failures are usually marked by the failure to process bills of entry and long queues at Beitbridge border post. At its worst, the system is said to have caused <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/12/beitbridge-delays-zimra-losing-millions-because-of-bureaucracy-in-procurement-procedures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some importers to redirect their imports to other border posts.</a></p>
<p>Away from the border posts, taxpayers were also experiencing e-filing problems and slow responses to getting tax clearance certificates. These kinds of problems only make doing business hard in Zimbabwe. Currently, <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/zimbabwe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zimbabwe is ranked at 159 on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Ranking.</a> And that is a very bad position.</p>
<p>Another notable problem is that when the system breaks down it becomes difficult to monitor imported commercial goods’ movement with a manual system. Consequently, this leads to corruption as exploitation of the manual records is easily done since there wont be an instant online reporting system when records are tempered with. The first half of last year alone Zimra recovered an astounding <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2017/07/corrupt-zimra-officials-tampered-data-system-chinamasa/">$120 million and arrested 21 officials for corruption-related practices.</a></p>

Africa Innovation Trust (AIT) has come up with a tool that will help in the fight against corruption.</p>
<p>AIT is a not for profit organisation that was established in 2015. They believe in the greater utilisation of technology to advance not for profit work. They develop innovations and deployed these innovations directly to the public. So far they have developed two of the innovations: T3 (Tender Tracking Tool) and ICU (I See You), which is the corruption tool we are talking about</p>
<h4>So, how does ICU work?</h4>
<p>The application was informed by the concerns raised by whistle-blowers in terms of safely allowing people to report incidences of corruption. Another concern was also in terms of quality of evidence that was being provided and ICU hopes to tackle that.</p>
<p>I tested out the app and the concerning bit is that before you turn in any evidence you are met with a sign-up interface. At this screen, you either enter your <strong>email</strong> or your <strong>phone number</strong> and I think this may be a cause for concern for some users. AIT might not be using this data or giving it out but it is a bit concerning that they will have a database of users. Data breaches are not common occurrences but when they do occur they usually have huge effects.</p>
<p>If you don’t mind that, you can sign-up and then start exposing any corrupt persons immediately. You may be wondering how exactly you can provide evidence. Well, there are four ways you can provide evidence. You can provide evidence textually which is the weakest form of evidence since this does not hold much power in a court of law. Users can also provide evidence by way of pictures, voice recordings, and videos.</p>
<p>These mediums provide stronger evidence in courts and can actually lead to convictions. At least that’s the intention of AIT in coming up with this app.</p>
<h4>After submitting evidence, then what?</h4>
<p>After you have submitted evidence, AIT is working with Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), Nation Prosecution Authority (NPA) and also the police. AIT  will provide them with the evidence and these organs are then best placed to use the information</p>
<h4>Use cases&#8230;</h4>
<p>I was in conversation with Benjamin Nyandoro, the Lead Resource for AIT and he said use cases for the app are varied. Instead of just thinking of corruption in huge sectors he also mentioned that the app can be used by school goers. He gave an example of a situation whereby the government donates books to a school and instead of making these books available to students, some schools may want to then sell the books. Through the ICU app, these students can then report such incidents.</p>
<h4>In case of emergencies!</h4>
<p>The application also has a ‘panic button’ feature where you can use in case of emergency. To use the panic button you don’t have to be a signed-up user.</p>
<h4>Other projects</h4>
<p>The aforementioned <a href="http://www.ait3.co/">Tender Tracking Tool</a> is a web-based application that was designed to assist the public and authorities. The application goes through the 5-stage procurement process of a project, tracks the project implementation and then performs analysis on the project performance: i.e. comparing baseline goals against the actual goals of the project. They are working on an election application</p>
<p>ICU is currently available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aitrustdevelopericuapp&amp;hl=en">Playstore</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think about ICU? Will you be downloading it anytime soon? Do you intend to use it? Let’s engage in the comments below</p>

We talk about lack of employment opportunities but we are not willing to branch out into other careers. A perfect example of an industry that is brimming with opportunity but we are yet to participate in is gaming.</p>
<p>Other countries in Africa have realised that there is a lot to be made and they have already started making strides to develop their gaming industries and to foster a gaming culture. A few weeks ago we talked about <em>a <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/liquid-telecoms-helping-east-africa-become-a-gaming-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive gaming tournament hosted in Kenya where the winner walked away with a $10 000 cash prize</a></em>.</p>
<p>When I got an invite to STEAM Africa’s Game Development workshop I was really stoked because these are the necessary steps we need to be making. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NdunaGirls15">Nduna Girls</a> partnered with <a href="http://www.letiarts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leti Arts</a> – a Ghanaian game studio- to make this event happen and the workshop was open to people between ages 12-25.</p>
<p>The turnout was quite impressive and not before long we were being taken through Eyram Taiwa’s (from Leti Arts) journey in the gaming industry. He walked us through his own personal history and how he entered the game industry and also a brief but interesting history of the African gaming industry. I bet you didn’t know that Mxit made an attempt to enter the gaming industry in 2003 but failed. If you did know <em>big-up</em>’ to you!</p>
<p>Eyram also talked about the well-known struggles of gaming in Africa and commented that right now it makes more sense to make games that have an educational aspect within them because of the stigma of gaming in Africa.</p>
<h4>It’s not as daunting as it seems</h4>
<p>On the surface, game development may seem like a herculean task and many will be discouraged before they even attempt because they feel like they won’t stack up. Eyram rubbished that kind of thinking and emphasised the importance of teamwork in game development. He gave examples of the many roles that are necessary to make a game. You don’t necessarily need to know physics because you can always part of the writing team, or a sound producer or a character designer. There are many roles to be filled and it’s all about choosing where you fit into that equation.</p>
<h4>Understanding the process</h4>
<p>Eyram also took us through some of the processes game development studios have to go through. We were split into groups and in our groups we were taught how game creators come up with game worlds.</p>
<p>Taiwa gave an interesting analogy where he likened game developers to God. Before you lose your minds and call for his head let me explain. God got to create the world and all that’s in it and similarly, game creators create the ‘game world’ and the characters that inhabit this world. All their abilities are also defined by the creator of the game.</p>
<h4>GCD &amp; GDD</h4>
<p>In our groups, we got to make Game Concept Documents (GCD) that inform the structure of the game that we were developing. During this process one group member took on the role of a consumer and the consumer would answer some questions which inform the rest of the group – the game creators- on which game to create for this consumer.</p>
<p>Once the GCD was compiled, the groups would go onto create a Game Design Document (GDD). This document would contain other elements in the game design process including the previous <em>concept</em>, to the <em>target audience</em>, and the <em>game mechanics</em> among many other things. It was a really insightful experience on how games get to be made from top to bottom.</p>
<h4><strong>We need to start telling our own stories…</strong></h4>
<p>As African’s we tend to consume stories about ourselves from western publications (I’m guilty of this too) and this is one of those things we need to address urgently. We need to take the mantle and change the image that has been created and the only way we can do that is if we take control of entertainment mediums and better tell our own stories.</p>
<p>Leti Arts has been doing this and they tell the African story by incorporating African heroes in their storytelling and game world.</p>
<h4>Also, check out this cool place to get African comic books</h4>
<p>If you’re a fan of comics you might want to check out the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.letiarts.afrocomix&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afrocomics app</a>. Eyram explained that this platform was designed to bring works of different studios in order to make it easier to find their work.</p>
<h4>Great start! Hopefully, there’s more to come</h4>
<p>It’s great that we can have workshops such as these to capture the imagination of the girls/guys still in school and get them to understand that these mediums of creation are not rocket science and they can also be used as a platform to make a good living. This was the first event of such a nature hosted by Nduna Girls and hopefully, they can do such a thing on a yearly basis at least. Oh and hopefully this can be turned into a week-long event where those interested really get a chance to build something together.</p>
<p>Overall, Kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/nduna_girls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nduna Girls</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Leti+Arts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leti Arts</a>… Keep up the good work!</p>

The program is also in partnership with Innovation Village Kampala, a Launchpad accelerator.</p>
<h4>The money is on the table</h4>
<p>15 Startups along with a 100 developers will get $250 each month for one year. On top of this if you apply and get accepted you will also have ‘exclusive’ access to Microsoft developers and Azure experts.</p>
<p>You probably know <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/tag/liquid-telecom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liquid Telecom</a> (AKA internet access provider, active in over 10 countries) but you have probably never heard of Innovation Village. Innovation Village is an innovation Launchpad from Uganda and they cater for ‘leading innovators and entrepreneurs.’ Here is a sneak peek of their vision:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are building an entire ecosystem of entrepreneurs and innovators in what is growing to become a business solutions provider for our biggest challenges or opportunities. From helping entrepreneurs launch and grow high-impact ventures to attracting regional and global opportunities, our ecosystem approach converges multiple partners including public, private, academia, research and civil society as one force for good</p></blockquote>
<h4>Everyone is welcome: Yes even the smaller guy!</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/08/liquid-telecom-microsoft-cloud-based/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiquidNEXT program is probably the result of Microsoft’s partnership with Liquid Telecom</a>. As part of this program, Liquid will be selling Microsoft cloud services (Windows 10, Microsoft Azure, Office 365 etc) on behalf of Microsoft.</p>
<p>When the partnership was announced, I thought they were only targeting large enterprise businesses but it seems I was very wrong. The startups and developers are being fully embraced and this move is Liquid and Microsoft putting their money where their mouth is.</p>
<h4>What’s Azure about anyway?</h4>
<p>Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. With the service, users can create virtual machines, SQL Databases, build applications and also have access to cloud storage.</p>
<h4>Interested in signing up?</h4>
<p>You will have to provide info such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The field you are in (e.g. Fintech, Gaming etc.)</li>
<li>Company name</li>
<li>Company profile</li>
<li>Website URL</li>
</ul>
<p>… among other things.</p>

<p>Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are used by many people in Zimbabwe so by utilizing them is ideal to spread a message to a wider audience.</p>
<p>That is why someone has decided to offer a public good by opening a <a href="https://twitter.com/Lostandfoundzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter page</a> dedicated to helping people who lost things and people who are looking for their lost their things. The Twitter page is called <a href="https://twitter.com/Lostandfoundzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Lost&amp;FoundZW</a>.</p>
<h4>About @Lost&amp;FoundZW</h4>
<p>The twitter account was opened in July 2017. The account’s status says:</p>
<blockquote><p>This e-service is only applicable for property that is not lost through crime. If you believe that the property is stolen, please lodge a Police Report.</p></blockquote>
<p>The page was relatively dormant since last year but from March this year it is gradually becoming active and more people are interacting on the page with as much as over<a href="https://twitter.com/Lostandfoundzw/status/989835488633737216"> 300 retweets on some posts.</a> So that means that people are now finding the page relevant.</p>
<p>For now, it seems the page has not been helpful as no ‘tweet’ of something that was previously lost but found has been posted. This can be attributed to the fact that not many people use Twitter in Zimbabwe so the number of people involved in helping the <a href="https://twitter.com/Lostandfoundzw">Lost&amp;FoundZW</a> cause is still too little. Perhaps if such a service was on a platform like Facebook it would garner more followers.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats/all/zimbabwe">Twitter is used by 7.62% of social media users whilst Facebook is used by 60.6% of social media users.</a></p>
<p>Anyway, you have nothing to lose by just utilizing<a href="https://twitter.com/Lostandfoundzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the page</a> if you are desperately looking for something.</p>

This is quite interesting.</p>
<h3>The problems at Steward Bank last year</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there is any business that fought a PR fire in Zimbabwe more than Steward Bank did last year. The bank had a series of downtime incidents inconveniencing customers. In <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/01/steward-bank-fails-deliver-online-banking-service-goes-offline-entire-day-no-explanation-provided/">early January last year online banking started to be a problem</a>. As time went on<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/03/steward-bank-apologises-unstable-banking-system-carries-another-system-upgrade/"> almost everything started to turn on its head</a>. People would get false bank balances, get charged fictitious transaction fees, some transactions would fail, balances would reduce even after transactions failed and reversing those transactions would take forever.</p>
<p>Officials from Steward Bank made <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/03/steward-bank-system-challenges/">countless promises about things normalising and problems being fixed</a> but the promises were broken as often as they way made. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/07/steward-bank-customers-sign-a-petition-threatening-to-take-it-to-court/">Social media went into a frenzy</a> and it would have been fair to assume the purple bank would not rise from the storm.</p>
<h3>A bank in the UK went through this exact same thing last week</h3>
<p>TSB is a UK bank which boasts 5 million customers. It used to be owned by Lloyds but was sold to a Spanish financial company called Sabadell a few years ago. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43923561">bank intentionally shut down various services like internet banking and funds transfer for a whole two days on the weekend of the 21st of April</a>.</p>
<p>This was to migrate their banking system to what they called an IT system for the digital age. Come Sunday when the time to switch everything back up: problems started. Confidently the bank had announced that the migration had completed and it would be smooth sailing from then on.</p>
<p>The worst stuff to happen to a bank happened. Customers could see and access other random customers&#8217; accounts! The bank then made an official statement that this had happened for a mere 20 minutes but everything was in order again. Except it wasn&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>Customers could not access their internet banking or do anything using the bank&#8217;s mobile app. The whole week ended with the bank &#8216;fixing&#8217; the problem and announcing that all was well and then social media going crazy as customers complained that things were far from fixed. This went on like a closed loop: Bank apologises and announces fix -&gt; customers discover they still can&#8217;t use services -&gt; customers shout at bank on social media -&gt;  bank apologises and announces fix&#8230;</p>
<h3>Sounds familiar?</h3>
<p>Experts in the UK say this is not a simple problem</p>
<p>A guy called Nick Hammond, a Lead Financial Services Adviser at World Wide Technology and who used to be Global Head of Networks at Barclays had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>The crisis at TSB provides a great case study for the problems presented by the sheer complexity of many banking IT systems, and especially, the difficulty involved in changing them</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Reporting on this madness at the TSB, BBC concluded by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>For TSB and the UK&#8217;s banking sector as a whole, the waves are going to keep coming in, and they are going to prove difficult to ride.</span></p></blockquote>
<h3>OK! So Steward Bank&#8217;s issues were not as unique?</h3>
<p>It seems time has exonerated Steward Bank. Not that we want to let them off the hook, no. But it seems banking IT systems are not as simple as we would imagine and especially if you want to change from one such system to another. At the time of these challenges Steward Bank was migrating to a system that would increase their capacity.</p>
<h3>More clear in the rear view mirror</h3>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight it looks like Steward Bank were actually brave to go through a digital migration. Surely if banks in the UK have to brace themselves for rocky storms as they change IT systems, Zimbabwean banks can&#8217;t expect any less. Steward Bank has already gone through it, perhaps the rest of our banks may have theirs soon.</p>
<h3>The last becoming first</h3>
<p>I mentioned at the time when the crazy was happening at Steward Bank that the purple bank was most likely <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/07/steward-bank-case-study-old-vs-new-thinking-broadband-economy/">going through the pain of being the pioneer in a different paradigm</a>. They dared to think like a digital bank and they went for it. It could have killed them but the cliche is true, what didn&#8217;t kill them only made them stronger.</p>
<p>Their competition is now waking up to a situation where the youngest from among them is now the lead in a country that is going digital, a world were financial services are changing from just the buying and selling of money to facilitation of transactions.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s now a numbers game</h3>
<p>It has always been a numbers game, just that the numbers used to be the net worth of your individual account holders. Already, this is not as important in Zimbabwe where banks&#8217; profitability in the last 2 years has been growing pushed by transaction fees whilst generally interest revenue has been declining.</p>
<p>Steward Bank pioneered agent banking to open as many accounts as they could. At one time they reported that they were<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/08/steward-bank-opening-least-3000-new-bank-accounts-day-says-ceo/"> opening 3000 accounts per day</a>. Of course the IT system was going to react to such volumes. However, the current business model for Zimbabwean banks favours whoever has the most accounts.</p>
<h3>Decision to place tech at the centre</h3>
<p>Back in 2015 <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/10/steward-bank-records-first-ever-profit-aims-for-tech-supported-efficiency/">when Steward Bank announced their first ever profit, they made it clear that technology was going to be their competitive leverage</a>. It looks like they have followed through with that. Followed it through stormy IT migrations and followed it through by<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/05/new-pleasant-surprise-leadership-appointments-steward-bank/"> recruiting and restructuring around IT</a> (buzz word is digital transformation).</p>
<h3>Techzim reader who initiated this article might as well end it:</h3>
<p>Our reader&#8217;s interpretation of things could be a good conclusion for now:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>And the TSB IT problems too. They remind me of Steward Bank and its problems with IT </span><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43923561" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43923561&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525033192309000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHC637PS_FTGgocUujCc6O2pUQ08A" rel="noopener">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/<wbr />business-43923561</a><span> . I feel these guys were unfairly blamed given how complex modern banking systems are. A comparison could be a great piece</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In line with attempts to mitigate cybersecurity concerns, <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/liquid-telecom-partners-with-serianu-on-african-cybersecurity--1241421?src=arador?GID=WEzOTNmNjkzZGE0NjU4NjQ6Y2E6ZW46Q0EF4-ARADOR-F5NGV6F3yiv6zHqrNAdzL9jWtnandew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet access provider, Liquid Telecom has furthered its geographical presence through a strategic partnership with African cybersecurity specialist firm, Serianu.</a></p>
<p>The collaboration brings together Liquid Telecom’s fiber network, data centers, and cloud-based offerings with Serianu’s <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/liquid-telecom-partners-with-serianu-on-african-cybersecurity--1241421?src=arador?GID=WEzOTNmNjkzZGE0NjU4NjQ6Y2E6ZW46Q0EF4-ARADOR-F5NGV6F3yiv6zHqrNAdzL9jWtnandew">business-oriented security monitoring and analytics solutions to offer end-to-end protection for businesses of all sizes.</a></p>
<p><span>Commenting on the partnership, Ben Roberts, Chief Technology Information Officer at Liquid Telecom said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>While digital transformation presents a vast opportunity for businesses today in Africa, the risk of cybercrime has never been greater. Through this partnership with Serianu, Liquid Telecom is not only ensuring that customers using our network and data centers facilities have access to the very latest cybersecurity solutions, but that we are also raising the overall level of cybersecurity standards and practices across the region.</p></blockquote>
<p>Together, the firms will work with clients across the banking and finance sector, along with clients in a number of others sectors, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and hospitality. Their services will include the establishment of monitoring and response systems — leveraging Liquid Telecom’s data centers and network fiber, as well as Serianu’s cybersecurity and consulting capabilities.</p>
<h4>What the partnership means for Liquid Telecom customers</h4>
<p>The arrangement means that customers in Zimbabwe and the rest of Africa who use Liquid Telecom’s network and data center facilities will now have advanced monitoring and incident response services via security operations center in Kenya.</p>
<p>Also, the same customers will have access to <a href="https://www.consultancy.africa/news/402/consulting-firm-opens-first-ever-cyber-immersion-centre-in-nairobi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serianu’s Arica Cyber Immersion Centre in Nairobi.</a> The facility which focuses on research, innovation and offering training facilities for businesses to simulate their cybersecurity solutions. Therefore, companies can leverage Seranu&#8217;s facilities to test their systems.</p>

President Mnangagwa&#8217;s government has been making a <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/silently-the-changes-to-the-zimbabwean-indigenisation-law-have-been-made-into-law/">series of policy reforms and introducing new provisions in current laws as it bids to undo past wrongs.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/govt-reforms-parastatals-full-statement-by-the-finance-minister/">As recent as last week,</a> Finance Minister, Patrick Chinamasa announced reforms that are going to be implemented in state enterprises and parastatals.</p>
<p>While the initiatives and what they are trying to achieve is commendable, the slogan is negated by failing to do even the most basic thing such as having a functional website. Many government websites are not functional yet the new dispensation is attempting to woo investors. Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA) is one important website <a href="http://www.investzim.com/">which is not working.</a></p>
<p>ZIA is mandated to promote and facilitate both foreign direct investment and local investment.  ZIA’s website is supposed to provide outside investors with information regarding the country’s investment environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/03/zimbabwes-e-government-takes-shape-country-introduces-online-company-registration-licensing/">In 2016 the former President Robert Mugabe launched the Electronic Government (e-government) programme</a> saying that the government will be working towards ensuring the improvement of efficiency in the public service and also computerization of all government departments. Nonetheless, the government is failing to walk the talk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/can-our-government-please-be-serious/">You might even remember Zororo Makamba’s video</a> in which he was blasting the Zimbabwean government lack of online presence.</p>
<p>Interest to invest in Zimbabwe has been on the rise but without a functional website where do ZIA think people can access information easily. <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/zia-clocks-1-billion-in-3-months/">Already ZIA has approved $950 million worth of investment project proposals in the first three months of this year.</a> Over 200% increase compared to the last year’s comparable period.</p>
<p>It only makes me wonder how many prospective investors we are losing by simply not having functional websites. A recent report by Zimbabwe Investment Authority CEO Mr. Richard Mubaiwa estimates that investments worth at least US$10 billion could have been lost under the former president. One can be forgiven to flirt in thinking that some amount of the lost investments was due to the lack of knowledge of Zimbabwe&#8217;s investment climate.</p>
<p>Frustrated by ZIA’s lack of online presence,<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/zimbabwe-government-please-read-this-before-you-think-of-following-tanzania-and-uganda-in-censoring-online-news/#comment-348991"> one interested international investors reached out to us Techzim to inquire about investing in Zimbabwe.</a> Whilst we are happy to help our readers, it&#8217;s worrying that prospective investors are now depending on us to provide them with this kind of critical information yet there is ZIA that should be doing for this.</p>

The company was awarded by the Zimbabwe Investment Authority as a runner up in the mining sector at the 2016 Investor Awards. This is of course important to mention because the cryptocurrency space is full of a lot of <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/02/beware-of-bitcoin-scams-that-promise-a-quick-buck/">get rich quick schemes and accompanying con theatrics</a>.</p>
<p>Second thing to mention is that I am not an investment nor financial nor technology expert.<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/03/didnt-enjoy-university/"> I am not an expert on anything</a> period. This is important to mention because you need to make your own decisions about these things and consider your own advisors. Be careful though because cryptocurrencies are a new thing and hence &#8216;expert advisors&#8217; may not be expert advisors at all.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let me tell you about the Goldchip Mining Asset (GMA).</p>
<p>Simply put the GMA is a digital asset backed by the most trusted physical asset: gold. GMA is a cryptocurrency token just like bitcoin. This token will be issued soon by the mining company, Goldchip Investments.</p>
<h4>Who are these guys?</h4>
<p>Goldchip Investments have a gold mine and claims in the gold rich vicinity of Chakari (close to Chegutu). They have been mining the precious metal since 2014.</p>
<h4>So why are they doing an ICO?</h4>
<p>Just in case you are embarrassed to ask: ICO stands for<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp"> Initial Coin Offering</a>. This is how new cryptocurrencies come to life. This is quite similar to how a business gets to list on the stock exchange through an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp"> Initial Public Offering</a> (IPO). As with an IPO, the cryptocurrency is first sold to larger investors before it can be acquired by the general public.</p>
<p>Glodchip are doing an ICO so they can raise funds to expand their operations and increase their current gold mining capacity. Generally ICO&#8217;s make it easier to raise funds than alternate routes for example listing.</p>
<h4>Why would a person buy this GMA token?</h4>
<p>Buying the token means you&#8217;re kind of investing in gold indirectly. Holders of the token will get a 5% royalty every quarter from the Goldchip Investments profits for that respective quarter.</p>
<h4>What can we compare this to?</h4>
<p>The best comparison for this token in the non crypto world is a redeemable preference share.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you asked: Reddemable preference shares are shares that you buy to finance a company and in return the company will give an agreed portion of their profits at agreed intervals (yearly, quarterly&#8230;) as long as you hold these shares. The company reserves the right to buy back these shares from you in the future.</p>
<p>This is very similar to what the GMA token affords you. Goldchip also reserves the right to buy back the tokens at the market value within 8 years of the ICO.</p>
<h4>What currency will they pay the royalty in?</h4>
<p>The royalty will be paid out in Ether (the Ethereum cryptocurrency). Etherhas the second highest market capitalisation in the world after bitcoin. It is currently the second most popular token after bitcoin.</p>
<h4>This is good for investors</h4>
<p>Paying out in ether is good for investors especially external investors because this allows them to access proceeds from their investment much easier and to transfer that money outside Zimbabwe. We all know that moving money is not so easy in Zimbabwe right now and the last thing you want is to receive your money into a local bank account.</p>
<h4>This is good for the government</h4>
<p>No fiat currency whether it&#8217;s the bond note or the US dollar will leave the Zimbabwean market. Goldchip are currently selling their gold output to Fidelity Printers and they promise to continue doing so. Obviously because this is the law.</p>
<p>Investors get their money in digital currency and thus there is no remittance of money at least money as our government understand it outside the country.</p>
<h4>When can you buy the GMA token?</h4>
<p>The public ICO will start early June. Right now the token is being sold privately mainly to large investors.</p>
<h4>This could be confusing&#8230;</h4>
<p>I know this could be a little too much to process if you are not too conversant with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain in general. I don&#8217;t expect this to be the only time we talk about Goldchip Investments and their coming cryptocurrency so hang in there&#8230;</p>

<h4>What exactly will they be streaming?</h4>
<p>The channels will be showcasing rugby related things including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Highlights</li>
<li>Player Profiles</li>
<li>Rugby Interviews</li>
</ul>
<h4>Follow the people…</h4>
<p>In other countries, they have dedicated streaming services for sports but since there are no similar platforms in Zimbabwe Sables will be using another route. Sables TV will be streaming on existing platforms <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZimRugby/?hc_ref=ARQIvWM6TGiZVvhceB8e6mx-ldf_w-ItLmT4WdNGeI_fmd4S6sFpUwkGbinzne-pVn8&amp;fref=nf">Facebook</a> and YouTube. This makes sense as fans won’t have to familiarise themselves with a less known platform.</p>
<h4>Secure the bag…</h4>
<p>Through these platforms, ZRU is also hoping they can drive sponsorship towards the game. Aaron Jani, the new ZRU President said an opportunity had presented itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not only a first for rugby in Zimbabwe but a huge milestone in Zimbabwe sport as a whole. It’s a unique opportunity to rally the whole nation behind the Sables. It is an opportunity to ride on the wave of belief and optimism that currently prevails in the country. The unveiling of the Sables TV and other sponsorship deals is a momentous occasion which we are very excited about and it is perfect.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a good way to engage the fans and keep them informed about the performances.</p>
<h4>Progress…</h4>
<p>In my view, this is a great idea and I think this should be replicated by the Warriors, Chevron and many other national sports teams. Going to these platforms could be a good source of exposure and some money. National teams have a wide reach and one would expect that local advertisers would be willing to advertise on their YouTube and Facebook platforms which would increase revenue.</p>
<h4>All the best to the sables!</h4>
<p>Hopefully, the sables don’t suffer the same fate as the Chevrons and they can qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. If you are interested in the Sables TV and getting to know more about what’s going on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh51ay0zoMU">you can check out the Sable TV’s first episode</a>.</p>

Lack of knowledge of such an arrangement and institution from the customer&#8217;s side is attributed to be the main reason why customers are not claiming their compensation. DPC public relations manager Allen Masadziruma said:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/dpc-pays-out-32m-to-depositors/">We haven’t really moved away from $3,2 million, there hasn’t been much movement since last year. We are really not sure if we can even surpass $4 million because most of the depositors of failed banks are not aware of the process.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dpcorp.co.zw/about-dpc.html">The institution was created in 2003 to partly reimburse depositors in case a bank untimely seizes its operations.</a> Currently, DPC is compensating up to <a href="https://www.dpcorp.co.zw/index.html">$500 for each customer of Afrasia, Allied, Interfin, Trust, and Royal.</a></p>
<p>The DPC is thus a significant player in the financial sector as it provides a safety-net for the savings, banking and payments systems and ultimately safeguarding the sector’s integrity.</p>
<p>And since the institution’s founding, a dozen of banks failed and subsequently triggering an aversion and lack of trust in banks. Accordingly, if customers are made aware of the existence of a deposit protection scheme, perhaps they may regain their trust in banks and choose banks as their preferred place of keeping their money.</p>
<p>Banks and most importantly The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is therefore tasked to engage awareness campaigns to inform people about their ability to regain some of their lost money when a bank fails. <span>The knowledge that their savings are protected gives depositors confidence in the banking system as a whole. If one bank has a problem, the deposit insurance scheme will reassure depositors in other banks that there is no need to panic.</span></p>
<h4>How to claim your compensation?</h4>
<p>Customers can claim compensation by easily <a href="https://www.dpcorp.co.zw/assets/dpc-claim-form-editable-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filling out a claim form</a> and wait for the money to be sent to them in a mere 5 working days into a bank account or mobile wallet.</p>

Yesterday was one of those days as two things were happening and they aligned in a seamless and interesting manner.</p>
<p>Firstly, yesterday was the World Intellectual Property Day and the theme of this event was <em>Powering Change: Women in innovation and creativity.</em> The random but interesting twist is that yesterday was also Women in ICT Day. These two calendar events coincidentally focused on representation of women (or lack thereof) in the two extremely influential fields of innovation and ICT.</p>
<p>In line with World IP Day, ARIPO (Africa Regional Intellectual Property Organisation) partnered with ZIPTA (Zimbabwe Institute of Patent and Trademark Agents) to host this event that was meant to raise awareness of intellectual property issues and to also celebrate the women who have made strides in this field.</p>
<h4>Innovation is there, but&#8230;</h4>
<p>The opening remarks were given by Mr Fernandos Dos Santos, the Director General at ARIPO. He feels that the problem with some solutions that have been created in Africa and the rest of the world is that these solutions have failed to benefit the creators. Due to lack of knowledge concerning issues such as trademarks, copyright and patents smaller players have been afraid to innovate as they are not sure if they will benefit from their innovations.</p>
<p>According to Dos Santos:</p>
<blockquote><p>ARIPO’s mission is to foster creativity and innovation for economic growth and development in Africa. ARIPO has been conducting wellness initiatives in its member states with the view to sensitise all segments on the crucial role that IP plays in promoting development.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Not enough women filing for patents….</h4>
<p>He cited that the total number of women filing for patents has tripled year-on-year but he also quickly pointed out that gender gaps in patenting still exist. The growth was not enough and at the current pace gender parity in patenting will only be achieved in 2076. If this is the situation worldwide then it can only be worse in Africa. Hopefully, awareness campaigns and events such as the one today ensure that this parity can be achieved sooner.</p>
<h4>IP is not just important in Tech or Science</h4>
<p>The president of ZIPTA, Brenda Matanga also shared a few thoughts at the event. She placed emphasis on the role that educating stakeholders of the role played by intellectual property. She touched not only on the importance of intellectual property rights of women in the technology and science but also on the importance of IP rights even in creative industries such as fashion, art, and literature.</p>
<p>She also said although the campaign was focused on women that did not mean men were not of importance and the greater objective of IP awareness movements was to empower all people and create an environment where all creators can flourish.</p>
<p>Lastly, Matanga said:</p>
<blockquote><p>if Zimbabwe is really open for business, then IP should be a part of that campaign and conversation.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Women in Tech –Edith Utete</strong></h4>
<p>The representative for women in tech at the event was Edith Utete who is a chapter leader at Women in Tech Africa. They have 15 chapters (organisations) in Africa and 6 outside of Africa. The vision of Women in Tech Africa is to inspire African women to drive Africa’s growth story whilst equipping these women with leadership skills. Every year they also host Women in Tech Week and each country they are in exhibits what women are doing in the tech space.</p>
<p>She talked about the importance of educating women on how to protect their ideas as there are too many societal issues that discourage women in playing their role in innovation. Edith cited issues such as prioritising marriage over careers, or even stigma from fellow women who feel they should not stand up and make a difference. Women and the general public are afraid of getting their ideas stolen and the World IP Day has coincided with the issue of <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/entrepreneur-writes-to-strive-masiyiwa-and-potraz-says-econet-stole-his-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an entrepreneur who is claiming their idea was stolen by Econet.</a></p>
<h4><strong>Women In Arts- Hope Masike</strong></h4>
<p>The women representative for women in arts was <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Hope_Masike#Break_from_Music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hope Masike</a> who I am sure needs no introduction. Her speech was heartfelt showed how hard it is for women to break-through and get fair representation in every line of work. She made valid points on how society has put women in the back seat and even cited common examples such as low attendance at soccer matches hosted by the women’s national soccer team or lack of inclusion of women in concert line-ups. She challenged us as Africans to re-socialise our society and make men understand that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Women empowerment is not men’s disempowerment.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Innovation is simply solving problems…</strong></h4>
<p>Mavis also talked about women and society in general better understanding what innovation is. She noted that as long as you are solving a problem that is practical, you are innovating. Innovation does not have to be Tech and science or something on a huge scale but rather just solutions to problems. She gave an example of her late grandmother who was a renowned herbalist who could cure even cancers but because her family did not understand the importance of her work no one recorded what she was doing or inherited that knowledge because they did not understand that this was innovation.</p>
<h4><strong>Women who have been making strides</strong></h4>
<p>Maunganidze also noted some women who have been making waves in the innovation space whilst also patenting their innovations. The women she mentioned are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mercy Manyuchi is an engineer who won the Total Startup Innovation challenge in 2016 for her innovations in relation to renewable energy. She has been using local materials to convert waste into usable energy. She is also the founder of Sustainable Tech, a startup which focuses on bio-energy.</li>
<li>Rujeko Masike –a lecturer at HIT- developed a small portable crushing machine for the small-medium scale mining sector and the innovation is actually in use. This innovation was a perfect fit because machinery in mining is usually tailored to large-scale operations. She was also nominated for the Royal Academy of Engineering UK Africa prize for engineering in 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were some IP Attorneys at hand and the last section of the event saw them act as consultants for free. The biggest takeaway from today was that as Africans we need to start prioritising patenting, trademarks and also copyright of the ideas we come up with. We also need to stop looking at innovation as something daunting and understand that all we have to do is come up with solutions to the problems we face.</p>

Through their subsidiary, Cumii, they are venturing into offering drone services in different sectors.</p>
<p>Cumii is a subsidiary of Econet Global and they focus on IoT solutions in various industries. They focus on various industries including connected health, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/press-release-econet-connected-car-wins-top-vehicle-tracking-award/">connected assets</a> (e.g. cars) and <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/03/econet-launches-new-connected-lifestyle-product-prepares-financial-reporting-season/">connected lifestyle</a>. Apart from IoT solutions, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/10/how-to-complete-technites-registration-and-become-a-super-technite-leading-your-own-team/">Cumii also offer on demand services through their technite program</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, there seems to be new activity in the Cumii camp…</p>
<h4><strong>Whats new?</strong></h4>
<p>Cumii’s website recently added a new Drone Africa page and the page states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drone Africa provides services that render drone solutions across multiple verticals within Africa. Some of the solutions offered are ;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Agriculture- Multispectral Surveying and Spraying</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Game Monitoring – Anti-poaching initiatives; search and rescue</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Asset Maintenance &#8211; Cellphone Tower Maintenance, Power Line Inspections and Solar Panel Inspections.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Video and Photography</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Mapping and surveying</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a diverse set of services they are looking to offer but it’s not entirely unheard of and they may be taking inspiration.</p>
<h4><strong>Insuring the agric industry</strong></h4>
<p>In South Africa, drone technology has been used in the insurance industry. Aerobatics is one such company that is in such industry. They use aerial imagery along with machine learning algorithms to provide insurance solutions. This technology is being used with the intention of lowering costs in crop insurance so that may be the route that Cumii decides to take with their Drone Africa venture.</p>
<h4><strong>Wildlife</strong></h4>
<p>In Malawi, Liwonde National Park has deployed drones with thermal camera’s for surveillance purposes and here’s an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/science/drones-africa-poachers-wildlife.html">interesting article on how they’ve been using the camera’s to limit poaching</a>. These are probably some of the initiatives Cumii will be targeting with the Drone Africa service.</p>
<h4><strong>Mapping</strong></h4>
<p>Drones have also been used in Africa in order to map land boundaries and also help with land ownership issues, which tends to be an issue in Africa. In Africa so far only 30% of land boundaries have been mapped so if Drone Africa is implemented properly it could really help with this situation locally. I’m not really sure if Drone Africa is the first in Zimbabwe to move into this space but regardless they offer a welcome entry in this space.</p>

The shrewd practices have consequently lowered the number of loans released into the economy.</p>
<p>However, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is reportedly in <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/04/reduce-interest-rates-banks-urged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussions with Bankers Association of Zimbabwe to lower interest rates on loans in productive areas of the economy.</a></p>
<p>Speaking at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has also engaged the Bankers’ Association of Zimbabwe to reduce interest rates on loans for productive purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year’s monetary policy introduced a ceiling of 12% per annum on lending rates and 3% for some bank charges.</p>
<p><span>In the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries manufacturing survey, 70% of the respondents said financial products for the manufacturing sector should have low-interest rates and reasonable terms to match. Therefore, this effort by RBZ seeks to ease the accessibility of financial products in these type of sectors. </span></p>
<p>Local banks are accused of <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/interest-rate-cap-wont-stifle-bank-profitability/">lending at rates that are Zimbabwean dollar based and not US dollar based which supposedly translates into high-interest rates.</a> Mangudya once stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are in a dollarized economy; we need to make sure that our interest rates reflect the currency that we are using. The problem in Zimbabwe is that (banks) are using the Zimbabwe dollar-based regime to determine interest rates</p></blockquote>
<p>While the lowering and capping of interest rates are good for borrowers who are struggling to secure loans, low-interest rates would more likely curtail the banking industry’s profitability.</p>
<p>Lowered interest rates would reduce the cost of borrowing and encourage credit-starved companies to borrow. So, to maintain their profitability, banks would need to increase their lending volume to offset the effects of lowered interest rates.</p>

Well, of course the authorities would not call it outlawing the news. In Uganda, the equivalent of POTRAZ has directed <a href="https://twitter.com/albertmuc/status/989157154656587776?s=08">internet service providers to block &#8216;unauthorised news websites.&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Uh, wait, what on the earth is an authorised news website let alone an unauthorised one? If it is authorised, is it still news? All governments in general are always tempted to control the flow of information. In more established democracies this temptation is usually checked by strong institutions and systems. In our young nations on this continent it&#8217;s not as simple. However, here&#8217;s why I would urge Zimbabwe&#8217;s government to resist the temptation:</p>
<h4>Restricting local blogs is handing even more power to Mark Zuckerberg</h4>
<p>The dominance of Facebook (and Google) in the digital advertising and publishing space is a cause for concern around the world. This dominance is not waning anytime soon not inspite of but especially because of the coming regulation regarding collection and use of user data online in Europe and most likely in America soon.</p>
<p>When African governments introduce license fees for online publications it will cause most of them to fold (of course depending on the fees). Where will people get their content after that? Facebook. Effectively the governments would be disempowering their citizens whilst entrenching a US company further in these parts. Even if they introduce a hefty fee for Facebook to be available here, Facebook can afford it.</p>
<h4>The government would be burying it&#8217;s head in the sand</h4>
<p>If the government gets inspired to follow Uganda it will find itself in a worse off place than if they let the local internet ecosystem be. The move will only cut off their own eyes from the conversation going on. If we can&#8217;t express ourselves on the broader internet we will express ourselves in WhatsApp groups and unfortunately for Big Brother, WhatsApp has end to end encryption.</p>
<p>If WhatsApp becomes a stronger information source than it already is right now it would be more disastrous for everyone. Random people on WhatsApp have no brand to protect nor a reputation to guard hence fake news will be the order of the day. It already is but this will get worse. Stories more damaging to the government will be cooked up (and believed) than any blog has the creativity to imagine.</p>
<p>As it is fake news on WhatsApp is somewhat kept in check by the online (and &#8216;offline&#8217;) news community. How many times has a story circulating on WhatsApp been dismissed by news brands that people trust? Online news publications are more effective in this function because they are real time. A fake news epidemic can be stopped dead in its tracks before it even takes off. I bet there are a lot of fake stories we never got to hear because a blogger somewhere disproved them before we even knew there was a story to disprove.</p>
<h4>The reality of this temptation for the Zim government</h4>
<p>So, yes this article has been more speculative than anything but the possibility of POTRAZ pulling a Uganda is real. Why?<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/potraz-and-baz-are-getting-married-here-is-whats-in-store/"> POTRAZ is getting merged with the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ)</a>. Hear me well, this merger is actually a good idea and is kinda becoming best practice around the globe.</p>
<p>However, the new regulatory body will have a lot of power as far as access to information goes. Whatever the baby that results from the mating of POTRAZ and BAZ will be called, that baby will be regulating both content producers/distributors and those who provide access to that content.</p>
<p>BAZ already has some <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/broadcasting-authority-of-zimbabwe-inviting-applications-for-licenses-for-some-stuff-we-didnt-know-needed-licensing/">ambiguous stuff that they list as requiring licensing</a> and this body is all but trigger shy if all the<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/10/baz-is-back-in-high-court-to-try-and-stop-kwese-tv-again/"> shenanigans with Kwese</a> and the recent<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/prophets-and-sangomas-banned-from-radio-and-tv-phew-thanks-baz/"> ban of prophets and sangomas from radio and TV</a> are anything to go by.</p>
<p>Anyway, Zimbabwe is not Tanzania or Uganda. Let&#8217;s hope it stays that way&#8230;</p>

George Charamba, Secretary for Information, Media and Broadcasting Services stated that the money will be channeled to the construction of transmission sites nationwide. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been favored with $6 million by Government so we can do seven new sites that are in Buhera, Chikombedzi, Gutu, Kwekwe, Maphisa, Murehwa and Nembudziya</p></blockquote>
<p>The announcement comes after the George Charamba earlier this month stated that the<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/george-charamba-says-government-to-soon-invite-applicants-for-12-tv-licenses-warns-entrepreneurs-to-be-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> government will soon invite applications to bid for 12 new digital TV licenses.</a></p>
<p>Despite the $22million to be disbursed this year, the project has a long way to be completed because as much as <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/govt-releases-6m-for-digitisation-project/">$103 million is still needed.</a> Expenditure of this remaining amount would be directed to buy transmitters and devices for the now increased incoming 24 new stations.</p>
<p>But judging by the current allocation, it will take a further 5 years to realize the $103 million unless they court investors. The situation is further compounded by the shortage of foreign currency to buy the equipment from China.</p>
<p>After engaging Huawei in both providing the equipment and installing it, Mr. Charamba said that local engineers will take over the installation jobs whilst Huawei continues to supply the infrastructure.</p>
<p>This arrangement is being made to reduce labor costs that involve paying Chinese engineers at higher rates compared to local engineers and also paying them in foreign currency.</p>

It is all happening due to the advent of technological tools and employee monitoring apps that let organizations monitor their employees like never before. With increased surveillance come increased concerns regarding privacy. Companies call it one of the ways to keep the employees productive or evaluate their performances etc. but sometimes, it can be a sheer invasion of privacy.</span></p>
<p><span>You are probably here with the concern already and want to know about how to protect <a href="https://employment.findlaw.com/workplace-privacy/privacy-in-the-workplace-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your privacy at work</a>. You are one of the many people in Zimbabwe with the same concern. But don’t worry, even if your company is under strict surveillance, there are ways you can protect your privacy.</span></p>
<h4>Keep workplace and personal devices separate</h4>
<p><span>You must know this rule already but it’s the most ignored rule. Don’t use the corporate devices for anything personal. All employers tolerate a certain amount of personal use when it comes to company-owned devices. Like if you are using the company’s laptop outside job hours, you won’t be monitored. However, if you have kept personal data on the company’s phone or computer, than the ownership of that data is blurred. If the device is taken away from you for some reasons, you may not get a chance to retrieve any personal data.</span></p>
<p><span>Want to keep your personal info to yourself? Here is some advice, keep separate work and personal devices. Don’t use the company’s laptop to access your personal email. Don’t log into your social media accounts from the company’s system.  In short, don’t mix home and office. </span></p>
<h4>Read the privacy policy of the company</h4>
<p><span>Most companies have such policies that require the management to randomly check on calls and emails exchanged on the company-owned devices during the office hours.  Since these belonging to the company, they have the right to make sure they are being used right. Some offices don’t restrict their employees from using the company’s gadgets for personal use but they do keep tabs on them. So it is in your best interest to know about all the policies your organization holds against your privacy.</span></p>
<h4>Find out how the company is monitoring you</h4>
<p><span>You know your company is monitoring, Ok great but how? Is it merely using surveillance cameras or also a monitoring app? Let’s suppose it is <a href="http://www.xnspy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.xnspy.com</a>, the employee monitoring app. You need to figure out what kind of activities does this app monitors. Xnspy allows you to monitor emails, internet browsing history, record keystrokes entered on the phone, track location, and read text messages, IMs etc. This means your company must be monitoring all of that on the phone it has provided you.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you know about that, you will know what your company can access on its devices. This is usually outlined in organization’s policy document. If you have checked the policies and nothing about monitoring is mentioned there, just ask. You have every right to know. </span></p>
<h4>Be careful with Social media posts</h4>
<p><span>We all love sharing our daily experiences on social media, right? But when it comes to sharing stuff about your workplace, you better watch out. The details that you share can be misused.  This can be against the integrity of your company. Even if it is not, it is always best not to show your workplace emotions on social media. For instance, anything you say about your boss or a coworker can easily reach them and this can put your job at stake. </span></p>
<h4>Don’t bring personal files to work</h4>
<p><span>If your employer is not using an employee monitoring app to keep tabs on you, there are lots of coworkers out there who want to know what you are up to and hence they might be spying on you. Such people have a habit of going through the computers of other employees. This also applies to any personal files you carry to the office. They will try their best to get their hands on your stuff. It is best not to bring personal documents to the work but if you must, then make sure they are kept safe. </span></p>
<h4>Look out for other indicators</h4>
<p><span>You may not be able to know everything about your company’s monitoring tactics since some organizations don’t document it all. Therefore, it is recommended to be on the outlook for other indicators that show you are being monitored. Apart from <a href="https://xnspy.com/best-mobile-spy-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using the best cell phone monitoring apps</a> and surveillance cameras, some companies go one step further for monitoring their employees. You never know if you are working for such a big brother. </span></p>
<p>There is nothing much you can do about if you are being tracked at work. However, if you feel your privacy rights are being violated, your first course of action should be to read your employer’s privacy policy carefully again. Then, you can approach the company’s human resources for expressing your concerns about privacy invasion.</p>

This is alleged to have happened a few years back but <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/econet-sued-us870-375-stealing-business-idea/">the issue was taken to court last year</a>. The complainant Ignatius Munengwa has now<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/entrepreneur-writes-to-strive-masiyiwa-and-potraz-says-econet-stole-his-idea/"> taken the issue to POTRAZ</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by the Herald, Munengwa wrote a letter of complaint to POTRAZ who happens to be the regulator for all telecommunications companies and to us this issue was a bit confusing.</p>
<h4>What can POTRAZ do in this situation?</h4>
<p>You of course expect individuals to approach POTRAZ when they feel cheated by telcos or such. However, Munengwa’s issue is not simple.</p>
<p>He is accusing Econet of violation of intellectual property (i.e stealing an idea). This makes it a bit more unclear because we are not sure if POTRAZ can actually regulate such an incident or if they regulate incidents in relation to the quality of service and practices in direct relation to the quality of service.</p>
<p>If POTRAZ is not in a position to hold Econet accountable they would probably advise Munengwa to take Econet to court. The only problem with that is: Munengwa’s issue is already in the courts so it’s not really clear what POTRAZ will/can do to help resolve this issue.</p>
<p>At the time when we came across this news, we assumed that maybe Munengwa’s issue was not going well and he decided to pursue another regulatory body as a last-gasp attempt to make things right and get some compensation. We also thought maybe he was trying to garner some sympathy in the public domain.</p>
<p>Instead of asking these open-ended questions we contacted Munengwa to try and understand why he had made this move. He of course could not divulge much since this is an issue before the courts and probably involves confidential information. However, he made his intentions clear:</p>
<h4>Munengwa felt it was key to notify POTRAZ (as they regulate the sector)</h4>
<p>Where we thought POTRAZ could not do much since they are just the regulator of the industry, Munengwa made it clear that he approached them with this issue precisely because they are the regulator and he felt there was something to be gained from that. Munengwa felt that POTRAZ is more aware of the issues in relation to the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>Munengwa, however, made it clear that the issue was still ongoing at the courts and disclosed that the next court appearance would be imminent. He made it clear that he was not giving up on the court but simply pursuing resolutions to the conflict from all possible angles.</p>
<p>This could be an attempt to put pressure on the High Court to rule in his favour. As impartial as the legal system is claimed or desired to be, we all know that it is composed of human beings like ourselves therefore any play to get the general public to react against Econet could bias the courts against the telco.</p>
<p>Some have suggested this could be a smear campaign against Econet but Ignatius says not at all.</p>
<h4>Time is money</h4>
<p>Munengwa shared that by reporting to POTRAZ he was trying to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible. He made it clear that the reason why most ‘small’ companies end up giving up on these type of court battles is because they don’t have the financial muscle to actually go through a drawn out court process whilst large companies like Econet can go the distance because they have the money.</p>
<p>What is not clear is how Munengwa expects the distance to be shortened by the involvement of POTRAZ. It&#8217;s not like POTRAZ can tell the High Court to step on the gas pedal or something. This would be interference with the judiciary and POTRAZ cannot do that. Or maybe&#8230;</p>
<h4><strong>Out of court settlement?</strong></h4>
<p>We asked Munengwa whether he was seeking to get an out of court settlement and he made it clear that though he had tried to settle this issue with Econet before going to the courts it had become clear to him that Econet did not want to resolve the issue with him. He cited the fact that he only resorted to going to the courts after reaching out to Econet multiple times before realising that he was not going to get any compensation from them in a more civil manner.</p>
<p>If Ignatius is still entertaining the possibility of an out of court settlement then maybe POTRAZ could make sense if he approached them to be an arbitrator. This would really be similar to you calling your aunt to mediate in an impasse with your spouse. It&#8217;s not because your aunt has &#8216;jurisdiction&#8217; but that you and spouse respect aunt. In the case of Munengwa then this would be engaging auntie whilst divorce proceedings are still ongoing.</p>
<h4>What is POTRAZ saying?</h4>
<p>We have been trying to get a response from POTRAZ but so far we haven&#8217;t got any. If they respond to us we will update you obviously.</p>
<h4>Econet?</h4>
<p>As they said when the issue first went to court last year, Econet are saying they cannot comment on a matter that is before the courts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>We are not legal experts…</strong></h4>
<p>Because legal issues are not a particular focus of ours we thought it wise to reach out to some legal guys and we will be posting their perspective on this issue and that will probably inform you and us what POTRAZ can and can’t do.</p>

Most key functions of the browser are now placed within a user’s thumb enabling you to browse whilst carrying your groceries with one hand, for instance.</p>
<p>Opera brags that its latest browser is for <a href="https://blogs.opera.com/mobile/2018/04/opera-introduces-opera-touch-a-cool-new-mobile-browser/">“for busy people who do other things while also using their phones”</a></p>
<p>But I fear that Opera’s Touch browser will encourage car drivers to drive whilst browsing which can cause accidents.</p>
<p>The innovation comes after the Norwegian software company conducted a research which discovered that 86 percent of U.S. smartphone users prefer to hold their smartphones with one hand while also doing other stuff, such as eating, commuting, walking or shopping.</p>
<p>When you open the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.touch">Opera Touch browser,</a> it starts in search mode and is ready for a user to start typing a URL or a search query to find things for you on the web. Then when you enter into a website, scrolling up will reveal a button at the bottom of the page that you can tap to access your other tabs or to start a new one.</p>

<p>With Opera Touch, you don’t have to make any additional moves or taps before you can start searching. That’s because they know you usually want to quickly find something online and move on with your life, or that your other hand might be holding something. That’s why they have reduced the number of steps before you can start your search to zero.</p>
<p><span>That alone is a handy additional given that lot of mobile browsers still place all of their buttons on the top of the screen (namely, Chrome), forcing you to reach up or reposition your hand just to change tabs. Being able to do that with just one hand is definitely a convenience.</span></p>
<p>And guess what? In the new browser, you don’t even have to type in order to search the web. You can also use the voice search function or scan a QR or barcode to perform your search.</p>
<p>That’s a useful function when you, for instance, see a product at a shop and want to check its reviews or prices online.</p>
<h4>Opera Touch also comes with a Cryptocurrency mining protection function</h4>
<p>The Bitcoin and cryptocurrency buzz has introduced a <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/someone-could-be-mining-cryptocurrency-using-your-computer-heres-how-to-stay-safe/">fraudulent activity of remotely mining cryptocurrencies using other peoples browsers.</a> Opera Touch comes with a function that a user will be at liberty to enable or disable cryptocurrency browser mining. Although, it comes disabled.</p>

The GDPR (General Data Production Regulation) is being released and it requires many companies operating via the internet to change their approach to collection of user data.</p>
<p>Companies that do collect user data are now required to have more restrictive privacy settings by default and all additional collection of data should be on an opt-in basis and not the current opt-out basis. Thus far, users have been giving a lot of information to Facebook without necessarily knowing what exactly they are giving to the site. Going forward, users will actually have to part with these details knowing how exactly the information is going to be used. Gone are the days where you have to go through multiple settings pages to give less information to social media sites like Facebook.</p>
<p>The GDPR is only in Europe for now so we will see if other continents will be following suit anytime soon.</p>
<h4>Whatsapp is doing the bare minimum…</h4>
<p>Whatsapp does not collect information about users, so how exactly would they know if a user has 16 years. If it’s like other services such as Facebook which asks users to enter their age then there is definitely no point for the feature to exist because everyone will just select the appropriate age regardless of whether or not that’s their actual age. If you were to look a my birthdate on Facebook, I’m apparently hundred-and-something years old. Why? Because Facebook gave me the choice to choose a random date of birth. So I did!<br />
This move is more of Whatsapp just saying, ‘if anything ever goes wrong, we did our part.’ The incentive to to actually use the app in a safe and responsible manner remains on the user.</p>
<h4>Other privacy-related features will be making their way to Whatsapp soon</h4>
<p>As part of Whatsapp’s move to avoid fears concerning data breaches, they will be adding a feature that enables users to download and see all the data that Whatsapp collects on them. This feature will be available to users throughout the world and is not specific to Europe like the age requirement.</p>
<p>Conversation surrounding internet privacy has recently just spiralled into overdrive following Facebook’ recent Cambridge Analytica scandal. The scandal really confirmed that fears concerning misuse of private data are not paranoia. If data you’ve given to a service like Facebook can be used to influence your opinion on something as sensitive as an election then we should be very cautious of how we view internet privacy.</p>

<p>The pay-television company has been on a drive to dethrone DSTV as Africa’s leading media content provider. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/03/kwese-dstv-share-rights-fifa-world-cup-2018-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year it even competed with Multichoice, DSTV&#8217;s parent company for the 2018 World Cup broadcasting rights but ultimately they both won the rights.</a></p>
<p>The TV Sports Markets’ report went on to list National Basketball Association (NBA) and ESPN as other rights holders to whom Kwese TV owes financial obligations.</p>
<p>This setback can be attributed to  Kwese’ massive expansion in many areas ranging from sports content to movie content that is consuming and stretching its financial resources. Consequently, breeding unexpected cashflow problems.</p>
<p>Joseph Hundah, Econet Media Chief Executive confirmed this by stating that Kwese’s portfolio of sports rights had “required more investment than initially forecast”.</p>
<p>Apart from investors funds, Kwese has still relatively few subscribers to generate enough revenue to self-fund it&#8217;s expansion activities since it was introduced two years ago. <a href="http://we%20do%20believe%20the%20money%20will%20come%20through%2C/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kwesé is thought to have 120,000 subscribers across the 13 territories in sub-Saharan Africa in which it currently operates.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://We do believe the money will come through," target="_blank" rel="noopener">One source quoted in the report said this year Kwese has already missed payment deadlines in January, February and March.</a> So now the rights holders are waiting for payment by the end of April in line with Kwese’s promise.</p>
<p>But there is a glimmer of hope for Kwese because its partners seem to be responding favorably to its situation. And it seems like this time it will eventually pay its dues. Hundah says:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>To ensure transparency during this process we have been in continuous communication with our partners who remain extremely supportive and have shown great belief in our business&#8230;..We do believe the money will come through</span></p></blockquote>

The ICT Policy was largely overshadowed by another initiative that was being launched by POTRAZ: The Innovation Drive. Since the event, the ICT Policy has proven to be a rare commodity and we are yet to see it or actually have a clue on how to get it.</p>
<p>The downloads section -where documents such as  ICT Policy documents from years past are found- looks like a ghost town and the last update on the page is the 2017 Cybercrime and Cybersecurity bill.</p>
<h4>What was the purpose of the launch event?</h4>
<p>I never understand why we (Zimbabweans) love having launch events for anything and everything. Granted, the ICT Policy launch event was coupled with the launch of the ICT Innovation Drive so depending on how you look at things that might have justified a launch event. But there are questions concerning the Innovation Drive itself because there were many questions that were not answered at the event and those questions remain unanswered even now as we get into the second phase of the Innovation Drive.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, these launch events end up feeling empty and ceremonial because if we are still asking multiple questions a month and a half after the event, then what was the purpose of the event?</p>
<p>Anyway, shortly after the launch of the ICT Policy for 2018, we went to a POTRAZ stand at the venue and asked for a copy of the ICT Policy and they informed us that they did not have one, either physically or digitally. The assistant at the stand recommended that we try to download the policy on the official page of the ICT Ministry. It made sense that they would have it there but when we went to the site there was no document to be found.</p>
<h4>So much trouble for a document that&#8217;s supposed to be public&#8230;</h4>
<p>We reached out to the ICT Ministry to try and understand what exactly was going on but to our dismay, we could not reach them. Looking for them was a polite gesture on our part because in all honesty this is a public document and we should not be looking for people in order to get our hands on it in the first place.</p>
<p>Today it still isn’t on the site and we are wondering how exactly to get a hold of this elusive document. If the ICT Ministry comes across this, please UPLOAD the new National ICT Policy on your website. We are tired of waiting for the document.</p>

The competition is in its second year and last year over 850 contestants applied so competition will definitely be stiff.</p>
<p>Ecobank Fintech Challenge gives African startups a chance to promote their fintech solutions partner or an opportunity to partner Ecobank. If given a chance to partner with Ecobank, startups can help with solutions to be implemented in one of Ecobank’s 32 markets (Zim included).</p>
<p>The CEO of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated stated that the company is dedicated to supporting innovations in banking and finance across the internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>We, at Ecobank, believe that the current winds of change led by technology and innovation will redefine how banks do business, and indeed the relationships people have with their money. We want to be at the forefront of this change, in partnership with Africa’s rising start-ups, and that is why we created the Ecobank Fintech Challenge.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>How to enter the</strong> competition?</h4>
<p>Entrepreneurs, startups and developers from any of Africa’s 54 countries can apply for the competition.</p>
<p>There are six areas of interest and your startup should qualify in at least one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remittances</li>
<li>Digital Sales/Marketing</li>
<li>Offline mobile to mobile payments</li>
<li>Digital Onboarding/ Account Opening/ KYC</li>
<li>SME Intra-Africa Trade Platform</li>
<li>Multi-Channel Corporate Payments/ Collections Ecosystems</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are you competing</strong> for?</h4>
<p>10 startups will be selected to participate in the Awards and Innovation Fair at the global headquarters of Ecobank in Lome, Togo in July 2018.</p>
<p>These 10 will go through a phase of pitches after which, a panel of judges will select the most impressive 3 from this list and award them $10 000, $7 000 and $5 000. The exposure to be gained from this might also be of value to startups that end up being in this top 10.</p>
<h4>Where to apply.</h4>
<p>Those interested can apply <a href="https://www.f6s.com/ecobankfintechchallenge/apply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Applications will close on the 20<sup>th</sup> of May so there’s almost a month left for applications.</p>

<p>Now, the social media giant is going to officially publish rules that determine what makes a user get banned on the platform. The rules have been shrouded in confusion and secrecy for years, though they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/revealed-facebook-internal-rulebook-sex-terrorism-violence">have leaked before.</a></p>
<p>The rules will be published in the background of reports which pointed out that Facebook has double standards when it comes to banning users.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ban-women-men-are-scum-double-standard-2017-12">For instance, last year it was reported that women are getting banned on Facebook for posting that “men are scum” but if you post “women are scum” you will get away with it</a>. And also, Facebook’s policy of banning images containing female body parts has been criticised by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/2778411/free-the-nipple-campaign-celebrity-supporters-laws-illegal-facebook-instagram/">women groups.</a></p>
<p>The California based company said it will also update the way it handles reports in a way that allows users to request a “review” when their post has been taken down on Facebook. Additionally, users who would report that a certain post has broken down the rules would be able to appeal the decision too.</p>
<h4>But this is not because of Cambridge Analytica scandal</h4>
<p>You may think that Facebook is taking this step as a response to the Cambridge Analytica. But according to its head of content policy, Mary deBree Facebook has been working on publishing the rules way before the Cambridge Analytica scandal. She said they <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/facebook-publishes-community-standards-moderators-2018-4">“started drafting in earnest in the September of 2017”.</a></p>

One such person who claims they were affected by this is Ignatius Munengwa. He claims Econet stole an idea he pitched to them back in 2011.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/09/econet-sued-us870-375-stealing-business-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he took the telecommunications giant to court over the issue</a> (the issue is not yet resolved in court) and it seems now he is back! He has sent a letter of complaint to POTRAZ (the regulator for all telecommunication companies in the country) over the same issue and seems to be fighting his battle on two fronts now.</p>
<h4><strong>A quick recap…</strong></h4>
<p>In 2011 M Comm pitched a security response product called ‘Panic Button.’ This product was supposed to be linked to security companies’ rapid response to Econet’s mobile network.</p>
<p>M Comm say they had already secured a partnership with one of the largest security companies to deal with the response side of things and were now just waiting on a mobile network operator (MNO) to provide the interface with the security companies. This is why they approached Econet and Ignatius Munengwa signed a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p>Munengwa also said Econet did not sign the non-disclosure agreement due to a restructuring exercise. After this, he provided more information on how the business would work including information such as cash flow projections and profit sharing between Econet and M Comm.</p>
<p>According to Munengwa, in 2012 he was informed that the project had been suspended. After following up on the progress of the project for 3 years, in 2015 he was informed that the project was no longer viable due to its potential in terms of revenue and subscriber growth or retention impact.</p>
<p>In November of 2015, the same year Munengwa’s idea was rejected, Econet launched Connected Home. The connected home was designed to offer home surveillance and security, automated services for some domestic features. The service featured a rapid response system and Munengwa felt his idea was being implemented and he was not getting his dues.</p>
<h4>To Mr Strive&#8230;</h4>
<p>He posted on one of Strive Masiyiwa’s mentorship posts (from April 12) on Facebook. He was questioning the values held by Econet Wireless Zimbabwe&#8217;s management and why his company did not seem to follow the words he (Masiyiwa) spreads on Facebook. Here&#8217;s what Munengwa wrote to Masiyiwa:</p>
<blockquote><p>I genuinely believed in your mantra of youth empowerment, innovation, integrity and fighting to protect your ideas and grow business in Africa through smart partnerships and therefore approached Econet to launch a unique product and discussed this with your management team here in Zimbabwe. To my dismay, I later learned that this unique product was going to be launched through the Econet Services without my involvement.</p>
<p>After trying several times to appeal to your management team, we ended up going to court to resolve this. My issue on this matter is how different your posts are to the ethos and ethical values represented by your organisation. The message you convey on various social media platforms is amazing but the integrity of the brand and team Econet in Zimbabwe is suffering under the reality that your company is seen to disempower young entrepreneurs like myself. A commonly held view among others that have tried to partner with Econet is this: you approach Econet for a strategic alliance and you work towards a solution and soon after exchanging information, Econet in bad faith, launches the idea or business model.</p>
<p>If your integrity and the values you promote on this platform are the core values driving your companies, then why is the management culture of your companies so divergent? I hope that you will take time to attend to what I am highlighting, if not for me, then for the sake of improving congruence of your well known personal values with the brands your name is synonymous with.</p></blockquote>
<h4>To the regulator&#8230;</h4>
<p>He has also now taken his issue to POTRAZ and wrote a letter of complaint to them hoping they can also help him resolve his issue. In the letter he detailed what happened and went on to express his disappointment in Econet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Econet has not acted in good faith and displayed a lack of integrity in the manner in which they have dealt with me. It is evident that Econet will disempower young entrepreneurs like myself for their own gain, rather than reward those who have genuinely engaged with them ideas that develop their business. I am therefore appealing for your intervention to review this matter as I seek equitable recompense for the utilisation of my business innovation which has been launched by Econet</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Can POTRAZ actually resolve this issue?</strong></h4>
<p>Well, we are not really sure how exactly POTRAZ can resolve this issue since it&#8217;s already in the courts but we did reach out to some legal practitioners and we will be looking at how and if POTRAZ can actually influence this situation.</p>

We all know that firms in Zimbabwe hardly satisfy the amount of investment required for Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) therefore Telone by partnering NUST mean that they have cut back these costs significantly.</p>
<p>NUST brings its researching expertise into this partnership whist Telone brings <span>hardware and the software and perhaps financial resources.</span></p>
<p>Telone managing director, Chipo Mtasa said the laboratory will be used to develop and provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_service">value-added services</a> for Telone. The internet service is one value-added service that Telone seeks to enhance through this newly commissioned laboratory.</p>
<blockquote><p>The way we had been structured, the way we were making money, it was just out of the voice-the landline&#8230;&#8230;..So as a team along with the direction from our principles, the shareholder as well as the board, we then said let’s transform TelOne so that it’s a converged services operator. Which means you can still do your voice landline but you can have other services which the market desire and are stemming out of the advent of the internet, she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So after many years of concentrating on landline voice calls and fax transmissions and lagging in expanding its internet services, Telone has decided to team up with an educational institution to improve its internet value-added services.</p>
<p>Telone said the collaboration comes at a time where it is attempting to redefine its business model in line the telecoms industry direction by providing application software to people and businesses. And to do this, it needs to collaborate with an institution that is experienced in researching.</p>
<blockquote><p>We notice that the business model will not work to combine just internet and voice&#8230;&#8230;We then saw that we needed to find applications that will allow people to say come to TelOne. That is why TelOne needs to do a bit more research to develop other products so that people can start accessing these products that they want, she went on.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Is it a marriage made in heaven?</h4>
<p>Yes, it is. Telone, a telecoms operator which is desperately trying to reinvent itself and compete fiercely in the internet business perfectly suits NUST, an educational institution which is science and technology oriented.</p>
<p>The fact that both institutions are government-owned, it makes it relatively easier for them to be able to work together since they all report to the government</p>

This comes in the background that, the Tourism and Hospitality Ministry is creating an online platform to register houses and lodges to boost tourism.</p>
<p>Tourism and Hospitality Industry seems like its taking its cue from The Rainbow Tourism Group’s (RTG) initiative which saw it registering houses and hotels on its<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/02/rtg-introducing-application-that-makes-finding-hotels-events-restaurants-much-easier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> RTG gateway App</a>. <a href="http://source.co.zw/2018/02/rtg-says-innovation-to-domestic-tourism-launches-app/">RTG reportedly raked in 10% of the $1.5million revenue through its online platform.</a></p>
<p>Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister, Prisca Mupfumira said registration is already in progress, having started two months ago and the platform will be operational by July this year.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/04/govt-goes-online-to-grow-tourism/">We are in the process of registering online all these small accommodation facilities, the SMEs and ensure that at a punch of a button, that in Highfield or Mbare (for example) there is such a home away from the hotel,” the minister said.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, the government is promoting <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharing-economy.asp">the sharing economy.</a></p>
<p>A sharing economy is a nascent economic model which focuses on the sharing of underutilized assets, monetized or not, facilitated by a community based online platform. The model is popularly used by <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2017/07/title-deeds-flexibility-broadbandeconomy/">Airbnb</a>, HomeAway, <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/05/the-case-for-an-uber-in-zimbabwe/">Uber</a>, Lyft etc.</p>
<p>In tourism’s context, houses or lodges or apartments that are not occupied could be listed for ready use on the online platform thereby offering convenience to tourists if they are in areas where hotels are not available.</p>
<p>An online platform would also help tourists to browse through a wide variety of accommodation to choose from wherever they are.</p>

We promised that the list would be continuously updated going forward and we are back with the statistics from the month of March.</p>
<p>The list has different statistics that paint a clear picture on the followership of the 27 sites, covering their website viewership numbers as well as their followership on popular social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Apart from being an interesting read, we also think the list will help inform readers/businesses on the sites on which to advertise their products and reach the widest number of heads locally. This list will be updated on a monthly basis and can be a useful resource to discover new content and also track how your favourites sites are performing.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s run through some of the notable shifts in the list for the month of March&#8230;</p>
<h4>New entry!</h4>
<p>We added a single site (zimbabwesituation.com) this time around but if we missed any news publication you can always tell us in the comments below and we will add them. Zimbabwe Situation came in and just made the top 10 causing some disruption.</p>
<h4>Massive drop from Daily News!</h4>
<p>The Daily News dropped 4 places from second to sixth. It&#8217;s a quite startling drop and it&#8217;s not exactly clear what is the reason behind one of the largest drop on this list.</p>
<h4>263Chat drops 5 places</h4>
<p>Speaking of large drops, 263Chat dropped from 12th place to 17th. There&#8217;s some consolation to be gotten from the fact that their presence on Twitter is still a force to be reckoned with as they boast the second largest following on the social media platform.</p>
<h4>Herald unaffected by pulling away from online</h4>
<p>Herald recently dumbed down their online presence in a bid to stop other publications from stealing their content and to push more sales of the hard copies. The move does not seem to have affected their ranking as they remained the 3rd most popular online news publication. Though <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/newspapers-decided-to-step-down-their-online-presence-to-drive-hardcopy-sales-and-curb-piracy-bad-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we did not agree with the move they made</a>, it seems Herald is fine.</p>
<h4><strong>Pindula and Techzim: No Comment</strong></h4>
<p>The numbers for Techzim and <a href="https://news.pindula.co.zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pindula</a> both grew but we will not be providing any analysis for that as these are both in-house publications. We will leave you guys to comment on what you think may have influenced the growth.</p>
<h4>Overall: a drop in numbers</h4>
<p>When we looked at the list more closely we noticed that the numbers for most publications actually fell. This is probably because in February there was still a lot of interest in news &#8211; following the &#8216;coup not coup&#8217;- and people were not yet tired of hearing just how open we (by we I mean Zim) are for business. That euphoria is probably slowing down now which is why most sites slowed down a bit.</p>
<h4>See you in April!</h4>
<p>In our efforts to make this list we tried to be as thorough as possible but if there are any sites that you are aware of that didn’t make the cut please notify us and we will continue to update the list. This month’s list now contains a previous ranking from the last time we released a list.</p>
<p><em>[For the sites that have <strong>N/A</strong> under <strong>Total Visits </strong>and <strong>Pages/Visit, </strong><a href="https://www.similarweb.com/">similarweb.com</a> could not produce the required statistics. We proceeded to rank these using their popularity on Facebook. We chose FB over Twitter because it is used more widely in Zimbabwe and for most if not all sites on this list, their Facebook following is far larger than the corresponding Twitter fan base.]</em></p>

The new chat service will be called Chat.</a> Google&#8217;s Chat will let Android users use features such as read receipts, GIFs and stickers, full resolution video and pictures, and functioning group texts on top of colorful texts.</p>
<p>The Chat is touted as a <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7953/killer-application-killer-app">killer application</a> as it will be supported by the relatively new communication protocol, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services">Universal Profile for Rich Communication Services (RCS)</a> instead of the conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">Short Message Service (SMS).</a></p>
<p>Chat messages will be sent with a user&#8217;s data plan instead of the SMS plan, so users will be charged for whatever (minimal) data it costs to send a message.</p>
<p>This move comes as a response to match chat services offered by rivals such as Facebook Messenger, Apple’s iMessage, and Facebook’s Whatsapp.</p>
<h4>Note this……. Chat is a service, not a new app</h4>
<p><span>Instead of developing an app that every phone maker has to add to its phones,<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-chat-rcs-faq,news-27024.html"> Google&#8217;s Chat technology will come to life inside of Android Messages, and other apps whose developers opt to support it.</a></span></p>
<p><span> Android Messages will be the default on many (but not all) Android phones.</span></p>
<h4>But Google will need service providers like Econet, Telecel, and Netone for Chat to be a success</h4>
<p>One of the salient points is that Chat will be a carrier-based service and not a Google service. This means that for Android users to use Chat, their service provider like Econet, for instance, will have to enable the service on its network. Therefore, Chat&#8217;s success hinges on service providers willingness in adopting it.</p>
<p>So, if you cant send Chat messages, know that your service provider has not subscribed to this service.</p>
<h4>Chat may not match Facebook&#8217;s Messenger or iMessage because of this simple reason</h4>
<p>With the growing concern of privacy and security by people characterized by <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/facebook-loses-37-billion-in-share-value-as-the-stock-market-reacts-to-its-data-sharing-scandal/">the controversy surrounding Facebook</a>, people may not use Google&#8217;s Chat because it doesn&#8217;t offer end-to-end encryption, a privacy, and security feature that its rivals offer. Ultimately, the service could fail to gain widespread use like its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/google-gives-up-on-google-allo-hopes-carriers-will-sort-out-rcs-messaging/">Google Allo </a></p>
<p>But privacy and security concerns are revered by Western countries than in Africa so Chat will most probably be a success in Africa than in the western world.</p>

When will the elections be held? Who will win? Do people believe in this ‘new dispensation’? Or are you hedging your bets on the opposition? All these things cannot be answered definitively but what I do think is certain is that as we get closer to elections (and during the elections) there will be an increase in politically inclined fake news.</p>
<p>Why do I make this claim? Well, let’s look at a few things that have been happening and why parties may turn to these low-blows to gain traction and more importantly votes in the upcoming Presidential elections…</p>
<h4>Why use ‘fake-news’ to win votes?</h4>
<p>This is a simple one. Because. It. Works. People believe that things they read on the internet are written by all-seeing, high and mighty beings who would never dare spread misinformation.</p>
<p>The only problem with that is, that’s not exactly how it works. You, yes you who is reading this post could start your own blog (right now) and start writing whatever you want about whoever you want and the chance of any accountability, if you are spreading falsehoods, is very unlikely. Because of the way people religiously follow anything and everything they see on the internet it makes it very easy to spread falsehoods about key political figures or the parties themselves.</p>
<h4>Why is it hard so to regulate this stuff?</h4>
<p>The biggest problem with fake news is something we have already stated above. Anyone can build up these stories and before you know it they gain traction.</p>
<p>We saw a perfect illustration of the effects of fake news in November: A message started spreading that there would be shortages of household commodities such as cooking oil and other food items. This message sparked a shopping frenzy as people tried to hoard as much as they could before this ‘shortage’ came into effect. A few days later we all realised there was no shortage on the horizon but it was too late. Stocks in shops had already been plundered and this bout of fake news actually had an adverse effect on the economy.</p>
<p>Similarly, with elections, this is how it will work. People will be driven into a panic and they will respond instinctively.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s hard to regulate this stuff because it’s almost impossible to trace who the sources are. Sometimes the fake news may not even originate from the party that stands to benefit but from an external supporter of the party. It may also originate from one party trying to tarnish another party’s image before the elections. The only problem is it&#8217;s almost impossible to know where these stories originate.</p>
<h4><strong>Which Countries Elections Have Been Affected By Fake News?</strong></h4>
<p>In Africa, <a href="http://africanarguments.org/2018/04/10/the-whatsapp-rumours-infused-sierra-leone-tight-election-social-media/">Sierra Leone’s election seems to have been affected by fake news</a>. A few days before elections in the Western African country news was spread that UN peacekeepers were about to be deployed. The rumour was being spread along with some out-dated photos and they were spreading across Whatsapp throughout Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>It’s reported that news such as this was a constant feature of the Sierra Leone elections and some feel the outcome of the election may have been decided by fake news.</p>
<p>Italy also made efforts to fight misinformation as they approached their general election (in March). It’s reported that in November two ‘explosive’ stories had begun circulating and these stories gained mileage as they could be used to influence the coming elections. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/europe-fake-news/551972/">One website reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What the stories had in common was the potential to cause turmoil in an already raucous political debate—one defined in part by anti-immigrant and anti-establishment sentiment—ahead of the country’s March 4 general election. Another thing? They were both fabricated, and it’s not clear by whom.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a poll from last year, a list of countries who are most worried about fake news was compiled and in this list was countries such as Brazil and France. These are just but a few examples of countries were politically inclined fake news increased as the country approached elections. Brace yourselves&#8230;</p>
<h4><strong>How to avoid the fake news storm…</strong></h4>
<p>This is the most important part of the equation. How can you dodge the ‘fake news’ that will be coming your way?</p>
<p>Well, it’s tricky because the way fake news works means once it’s started spreading on Whatsapp, people begin to talk about it and once it starts spreading via word of mouth that’s a sign of something that has already spun out of control.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s talk solutions. If you receive any news (especially shocking news!) on platforms such as Whatsapp or Facebook/Twitter, make sure you verify how accurate these stories are before you start spreading them. You can check out sites that offer more reliable and accurate news such as <a href="https://news.pindula.co.zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pindula</a>, <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herald</a>, or <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsday</a>. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/list-of-zimbabwes-top-news-platforms-and-their-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can check out our compilation of online news publications</a> and then take your pick from there. Yes, sometimes these sites may take the bait (but these are very rare situations).</p>
<h4><strong>I AM NOT PARTISAN (I try not to be, at least)!</strong></h4>
<p>Well, the thing with fake news is, it could be used by any of the parties so I will not try to guess which party will use fake news to gain votes. I’ll leave that one to you, my dear readers.</p>

We have <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/xioami-starts-selling-redmi-5-redmi-5-plus/">been over this</a>, the very cheap phones always come at a cost.</p>
<p>On the other hand there are overly expensive phones whose purchase price is worth several cows now I don&#8217;t know about you but to me that seems a little bit of an overkill. Parting with a whole herd just so you can have a wonderful selfie just doesn&#8217;t seem right. I know a lot of people with an S8 that never use two thirds of the features.</p>
<h4>Budget phones are the answer</h4>
<p>There are a lot of great phones that offer bang for buck. They come with a battery that will last a whole day even with 9 hours on screen time, near perfect cameras for those who obsess over this sort of thing, 32GB of ROM, at least 3GB of RAM, dual SIM capacity, expandable slot and lots of wonderful stuff including updates to Nougat and/or Oreo if they don&#8217;t come with it out of the box.</p>
<p>What if I told you could get these phones for near $200 or less? Great right? I have spent a long time researching these phones for myself and friends. You are free to do your own research but believe me when I tell you they are awesome phones.</p>
<p>NB: These phones are not listed here in order of awesomeness or anything.</p>
<h4>The Xiaomi Redmi 5</h4>

<p>Xiaomi is the king of budget phones in my book and you can never go wrong whatever device you buy from them but the Redmi 5 is in a class of its own. There are many variants of this device with different bands ( it can support CDMA 2000 for example) and screen resolution. The phone comes in three colours Black, Rose Gold and Blue</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get the 2GB/16GB version for around <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_1509274.html?lkid=13875259">$119 from Gearbest</a>, Geekbuying</li>
<li>The 3GB/32GB version for as low as<a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_1509271.html?wid=1349303&amp;lkid=13875275"> $150 from Gearbest</a></li>
<li>The 4GB/64GB version which comes with a 1080p display for $<a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_1509265.html?lkid=13875284">200 from Gearbest,</a></li>

<p>A sibling to the Redmi 5, the 5A comes with a better selfie (front) camera, is a little smaller but it comes with the respectable Snapdragon 435 so this is not a device to sneer at.</p>

<p>You remember Nubia right? It is a popular phone in Zimbabwe, well sort of. Nubia is an offspring of ZTE and everyone except the crazy protectionist U.S Congress loves ZTE. The M2 comes with two dual rear cameras, the power saving Snapdragon 625 and as a 4GB/64GB build.</p>
<p>The downside is it comes with Android 6.0 out of the box. Android 6.0 is a capable O.S. but if you like living on the edge you can always upgrade to Nougat, or soon Oreo using a Lineage ROM Lineage is an offspring the once popular Cynagenmod so this will be like two royal offspring hitting it off. Symmetry huh.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get the device from Geekbuying<a href="http://fas.st/ShK-Jp"> for $160</a></li>
<li>There is lite version which comes in a 3GB/32GB configuration but it has one rear camera. You can get it for <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_699126.html?lkid=13875488">$118 from Gearbest</a>.</li>

<p>This veritable photography powerhouse comes with a 3GB/32GB variant. The device comes with Huawei&#8217;s own Kirin processor while on paper this has less muscle than Snapdragon&#8217;s series it&#8217;s so well optimized that this will not matter much in real world use cases. While this comes with Android 6.0 you can easily upgrade to Nougat. The camera app for this phone is to die for not that Huawei needs an introduction in Zimbabwe anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Global version can be purchased for <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_864692.html?lkid=13875511">$160 from Gearbest</a></li>
<li>It is also selling on <a href="http://fas.st/NJwSd">Geekbuying for the same price</a></li>

<p>Technically you will have to fork out at least $22 more to get the Honor 7X but it&#8217;s close enough to $200 I am including it here. It is naturally the successor to the 6X. However while the 6X comes in silver this one comes in blue. I am referring to the linked devices here not the entire range of products. So please no trolling.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cheapest version can be found on <a href="http://fas.st/6-lBa">Geekbuying selling for $220</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>NB 3GB/32GB means a phone has a 3GB RAm and 32GB ROM pairing and so on.</p>
<p>In making my list I deliberately omitted a lot of great brands such as Elephone as they might not be well known to a lot of people so this list is not exhaustive. I can guarantee you though that all the phones listed above are beautifully crafted, come with good battery life, have excellent cameras and offer great value for money.</p>
<p>Three shops were considered in the making of this list: Gearbest, Geekbuying and Aliexpress. The later proved to be useless as most of the phones above could not be delivered to Zimbabwe. It is however a good shop for accessories.</p>
<h4>Duty and Making payments</h4>
<p>You will need a MasterCard/Visa card that can make international payments to buy these items from their relevant stores. I would strongly recommend the FBC MasterCard not only can you load it using USD you can also receive wire transfers from abroad onto this card. The Steward prepaid Visa Card is also a good card.</p>
<p>Phones have to pay 25% duty and 15% VAT. This is levied on what ZIMRA calls Value for Duty Purposes which is close to the purchase price. In anycase the cost of buying a phone online is almost always cheaper than buying an equivalent phone here in Zimbabwe. The above phones (or equivalent versions) sell for around $450-$500 or even in Zimbabwe so &#8230;</p>

In keeping with the messaging application&#8217;s update, they will also be adding group calls sometime this year.</p>
<h4>What’s new?</h4>
<p>On older versions of Whatsapp, if you wanted to revoke someone’s administrative rights you had to remove them entirely from the group and then add them back as a normal user. With this update, admins will be able to take away another user’s admin badge without removing them from the group entirely. There&#8217;s a new &#8216;Dismiss as admin&#8217; option that&#8217;s been added if you long press on the name of a group member in the group info section:</p>

<p>In terms of usefulness, this is more of a tweak to refine the overall experience and less of a big deal. I’m also not sure if this update is available for all users or it’s just for beta testers. Usually, features are rolled out to beta testers first, and then to the rest of the users after the features have been proven to be stable.</p>
<p>The update is available for both Android and iOS which probably means if you update you will be able to access it.</p>
<h4><strong>More features on the way…</strong></h4>
<p>Recently, Whatsapp added more useful features; <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/whatsapp-to-allow-users-to-recover-deleted-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week they were beta testing a feature to allow users to re-downloaded photos they had deleted.</a></p>
<p>Whatsapp is also testing out group calls for both voice and video calling but this feature has not yet been made available to the public. Even beta testers are locked out of this one but it’s one of the more important features that we have come across in the last few months. It’s also not clear how exactly this will work yet but it will most probably be announced sometime this year.</p>
<p>When the feature eventually comes to users it might be a very cheap way for small businesses to make conference calls or just a great social tool for a group of friends looking to catch up. This will probably be the biggest update since Whatsapp added the Status feature last year (unless I’m missing something). A lot of people, myself included, will be waiting for this feature.</p>

The mobile money service has just introduced the <em>Fees for less Promotion </em>in anticipation of the upcoming school term.</p>
<h4>What is this promotion about?</h4>
<p>With the school term just around the corner (8 May), NetOne is offering a great deal to parents who pay fees using OneMoney. The first 100 parents who pay school fees using OneMoney will be getting 100% of that fees back. That means if you are among this first 100, NetOne is essentially paying your child’s/dependant’s fees for you. I suspect this one will be a big deal considering the economic hardships being faced in our country.</p>
<h4>500 reasons why schools should sign up!</h4>
<p>NetOne probably thought hard and clear and realised that there is no point in encouraging parents/guardians to pay via OneMoney if the schools don’t accept the payment. Most schools are registered with EcoCash but NetOne is trying to ensure that schools also have a OneMoney account as they are promising $500 to the first 50 schools who register. This will probably see way more than 50 schools sign up as the incentive is doubled for schools who will get 500 if they make this 50 whilst also increasing chances of getting fees earlier if parents pay using OneMoney.</p>
<h4>There are other prizes to be won as well&#8230;</h4>
<p>During the promotion, those who pay school fees using OneMoney also stand a chance to win fortnightly vouchers worth $100 dollars. This means more than a 100 parents/guardians stand to benefit.</p>
<p>On the school&#8217;s side, they could win a computer lab, generators and one-fi devices so there&#8217;s a lot at stake here and both schools and parents/guardians are being given reasons why they should sign up.</p>
<h4><strong>How long will this promotion go on?</strong></h4>
<p>The Fees for less Promo will be running from the 22<sup>nd</sup> of April(today) until the 30<sup>th</sup> of May. It might be advisable to pay as early as possible as a lot of people will be trying to get in that esteemed 100 as early as possible.</p>
<h4>OneMoney isn’t going down without a fight!</h4>
<p>We recently talked about <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/if-i-were-telecel-or-netone-heres-what-i-would-do-to-fight-ecocash-dominance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what NetOne and Telecel need to do in order to make sure they catch up or at least offer decent competition to EcoCash</a>. In that article, an example was given of how NetOne and Telecel could give registration incentive as little as a single dollar and that would pull a few people to their mobile money service. With <em>Fees for less </em>NetOne is giving mobile money users way more than that so they will probably get a lot more people to buy in.</p>
<h4>NetOne is essentially saying we can offer more than OneFusion</h4>
<p>This move targets so many people as well. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/onefusions-new-new-bundles-first-right-steps-towards-better-mobile-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NetOne probably realised they have subscribers who are already on the network but are only there for OneFusion</a>. Now, because of this promotion, these subscribers will go the extra step and sign up for OneMoney. I mean, if you already have the line you don’t have to go through a process as long as those subscribing to NetOne for the first time, so there’s no reason not to.</p>
<p>Considering the possibilities at hand even those subscribing for the first time have a really good reason to do so. I mean the possibility of getting the entire school fees you pay given back to you is obviously worth putting up with a few queues.</p>
<p>NetOne also understands that the goodwill they will garner from this move is going to be great.</p>
<p>When parents get to talking about howNetOne fully paid them what they had paid for fees, they will not focus on the fact that it was 100 parents who benefitted, but on the fact that NetOne PAID! The amount of goodwill they will get from this will be huge and probably more people will join the service, which is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>The page no longer appears if you search for them via Facebook. What comes up instead is a Bustop TV clone with a mere 3 000 Facebook likes.<a href="https://twitter.com/bustoptv/status/987935908027621387"></a></p>
<p>Bustop TV have no knowledge who this Jessy Miller is and the hackers seem to have made the page invisible or maybe they’ve taken it down entirely. It’s not really clear what their intentions are as of yet. This lack of activity makes it harder to predict who or what the motivation of these hackers is. Are they just having fun? Are they intentionally sabotaging the page to settle some scores? Maybe an inside job? It’s all a bit misty, to be honest…</p>
<h4>We talked about Facebook hijacking last week… This is not that</h4>
<p>The lack of activity probably indicates that it is not similar to the <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/a-victim-of-the-recent-facebook-spamming-heres-how-to-fix-the-problem-and-avoid-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook hijacking extension we reported last week</a>. The intentions of that extensions are more clear and predictable whereas this looks like something that has been done by a human.</p>
<p>In the early hours of today the online media entity took to Twitter to inform their audience of the troubles they were facing on their Facebook platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Friends our Facebook page has been hacked and all the admin have been removed. We have lost control with Facebook page. Those who can help us recover control plz help.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also tweeted to Facebook’s official Twitter account seeking assistance:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@facebook</a>  our official page have been hacked and all the admins been removed.Please help.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bustop TV’s best bet might be reaching out to Facebook support and reporting this incident, which I hope they have already done.</p>

The app is meant to teach beginners JavaScript.</p>
<p>The best part of all this is it&#8217;s entirely free. Free to download, and the courses are free as well so this is a perfect way to learn and see if this is a viable career path for you without parting with your valuable dollars. I think this is a great way to start coding if you are Zimbabwean (or in any developing country) and you are very conscious of how you use your money.</p>
<h4>What’s the point of this Area 120 program?</h4>
<p>Area 120 has been around for two years and Grasshopper is their most mainstream offering as their other projects have been quite niche.</p>
<p>The application is a ‘passion project’ by some internal Google employees and they built it because:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coding is becoming such an essential skill, and we want to make it possible for everyone to learn even when life gets busy. We made Grasshopper to help folks like you get into coding in a fun and easy way.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Back to Grasshopper&#8230;</h4>
<p>Right now the app offers the basics on JavaScript. The app is setup in a way that tackles the lessons in an interesting manner and is supposed to be inviting for beginners.</p>
<p>The app has some beginner courses, starting with ‘The Fundamentals.’ In this stage, users learn how code works and get acquainted with some of the key programming terms such as functions, variables, strings, for loops, arrays, conditionals and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>There are two other courses where users go on to learn how to draw shapes using a library and then creation of more complex functions using a similar library (D3 library).</p>
<p>There are visual puzzles to ‘develop your problem-solving skills and solidify coding concepts’ according to the app description. The reason why there is a focus on visual learning is because the goal of the app is to get coders (or would-be-coders) proficient in the basics and core concepts, so they take the next steps in their coding education – be it online classes, attending bootcamps or the grasshopper online playground which enables coders to create interactive animations.</p>
<p>There are also some features that are meant to motivate users: achievements, progress indicators and coding streaks. There will be more features added to the app as time goes on and the curriculum will also grow.</p>
<h4>There&#8217;s more to look forward to as well</h4>
<p>Grasshopper has promised to add more content to The Fundamentals section and an entirely new course. The new course will still be based on JavaScript, as the team behind grasshopper made it clear they have no intention of expanding beyond the language which is used by over 70% of professional developers. There’s a lot to interact with and also look forward to going forward.</p>
<p>The fact that more content will be coming and will all be free makes this one of those must-have apps. I mean what&#8217;s the reason not to have this?</p>
<p><em>The app is available </em>on<em> Android and iPhone. Android users can download it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.area120.grasshopper&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</em></p>

We don&#8217;t always meet your expectations but that is what drives us to work everyday. We appreciate every form of feedback we get. It&#8217;s humbling when that feedback is to the effect that we have been a positive influence on you.</span></p>
<p><span>This was the case today when we got an email from Gift Marimo a self taught developer. It made us call him and ask for permission to publish his email. Here&#8217;s what he wrote us:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Hie Techzim. </span></p>
<p><span>My name is Gift Marimo. l am 24 years old and l am the founder of a software development company called Codel Systems with a website (</span><a href="http://www.codel.co.zw/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://www.codel.co.zw&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524319798543000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFfryVTXnnZFyoMa5xgTob3XSlUEg">www.codel.co.zw</a><span>). l am a self-taught software developer who started the journey of software development early 2016. I started Codel in mid 2016 and incorporated it in mid 2017 here in Zimbabwe. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently Codel is employing 5 software developers including me, 1 marketing personnel and 1 graphic designer equal to 7. I decided to focus more on latest technologies like blockchain, IoT, AI, Machine Learning, Big Data. On blockchain Codel team is developing a framework that can allow local developers to build blockchain and Decentralised Apps (DApps). We are doing this because we want local developers to have access to locally developed intelligent frameworks whether virtually or physically, but most preferable is physical access because we still have a challenge of developers who are not capable to deliver high quality modern technology apps. </span></p>
<p><span>We are also doing thorough researches on key sectors that blockchain can be used to improve the sectors. One of it being healthcare sector, we are documenting decentralised solutions that could cause the improvement of our healthcare sector. l worked in healthcare sector for over 20 months as an IT technician and a web developer and the conditions there as far as infrastructures to record crucial data on real time is concerned are really not impressive at all. We are also working on solutions that can connect Zimbabwe and Africa to the internet of things (IoT). </span></p>
<p><span>I believe that access to updated information and libraries should not be that expensive especially access to educative information. I am not happy with our education system, its way too theoretic. STEM has been introduced but can we talk of “Technology” without introducing coding as a compulsory subject from early learners like zero grades? Coding is like any other native language like Shona or Ndebele hence the need to introduce it to learners at early stage just like teaching the toddler to say “Sadza &#8211; Tada”. </span></p>
<p><span>5G is around the corner, it will improve the speed of connectivity by a remarkable percentage as compared to the current hence we should be ready to embrace that and use it to implement improvements in our education systems and businesses. I believe that Codel will become successful on its plans to develop education systems that will connect every learner from down to top everywhere regardless of geo-location. I believe that we are the key objects that can thrust our economy forward by changing the operating models as Zimbabweans.</span></p>
<p><span>Currently we are building 3 mobile applications, I will come back with detailed explanation when closer to launch date. The one is a partial solution to transport problems, the other one is the solution to financial service and the other one is a pretty solution to general retail space. What we are trying to achieve is just bringing convenience to everyone through executing operations on finger tips. We want to push mobile economy to the limits so that everyone learns technology by using it. The platforms will create employment and give a lot of value to end-users. Since there is no longer a need to carry a computer around &#8211; mobile phones are becoming better than computers, we have to bring even complex operations to a mobile device so that everywhere could be a workspace. Well enough of introducing Codel.</span></p>
<p><span>My main concern as a software developer is having more developers who are capable of developing our nation through software. Every business has became a software business, whether transport, retail, food, healthcare, education, agriculture. Business models are being re-written by software and the journey is just starting. The journey is not short and will never be easy but it can only be achievable by having equipped people ready to make the journey a reality. The biggest investment I prefer to be done is the investment in young people especially those in the tech space. When they are fully equipped with &#8211; especially software development skills, ideas will never end. I also mentioned the issue of investing in young people who are in tech space when I attended a Youth Forum which was held at Rainbow Towers in February this year and i will continue to mention the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me cut my story here but I want to end it by thanking you Techzim team for giving us a platform to get latest tech news. I started following Techzim around 2013 and that is when I started to have an interest in technology due to your rich posts. Keep up the good work team, Africa needs people like you.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you Gift, we wish you well and we look forward to be publishing the amazing stories around the work you are doing. Thank you Techzim community&#8230;</p>

You may have heard of the program but what you may not know is that Zimbabweans and other Africans can now apply for the internship.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about why this is a big deal and how you can enter the internship…</p>
<p>HNG’s program began as an incentive to attract more people to development in Nigeria. They believe interns may be passionate  but they often lack basic infrastructure and their program has gone a long way to</p>
<p>The internship is in its 4<sup>th</sup> phase and this will be running from the <strong><em>1<sup>st</sup> of May to the 28<sup>th</sup> of July</em></strong>. The first internship was in 2016 and a total of 170 interns were trained with 15 finalists at the end of the program. The second internship took place in January of 2017 and this time the number had ballooned to 848 interns and 30 finalists. 2017’s internship program was hosted twice and in August the third session began and over 1 100 aspiring developers and designers signed, whilst this time around there were 100 finalists.</p>
<p>As noted above, the previous 3 internships had been open only to Nigerians but thankfully the fourth edition is Pan-African, so everyone in Africa is free to join this time around. This will probably mean there will be many more people signing up and more finalists.</p>
<h4>How do you enter?</h4>
<p>The way the internship is structured is quite interesting actually. There’s NO entrance exam anyone who is interested just signs up and is inducted. Because the internship is hosted online there is no problem with having high numbers of interns and the numbers are trimmed down pretty easily as the internship progresses.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how the numbers are reduced. Well, HNG creates ‘exciting challenges’ on their slack channel every week and those who can solve the challenges get to keep their jobs.</p>
<h4>What’s in it for the interns?</h4>
<p>Interns get paid $20 on a weekly basis, so you get to gain experience, learn and earn all at the same time. Apart from the fact that interns are obviously paid for the work they are doing, the other reason they have been getting paid is for them to be able to also pay minor bills such as electricity or saving up to get equipment to help them better in their craft.</p>
<p>All this from the comfort of your home, or wherever you are doing the internship from. If you are an aspiring developer/designer or you know someone interested in this field you might want to check this out.</p>
<p><em>[Update]: Interested developers can no longer sign up for the program as the deadline has now expired. If you are interested you will have to wait for the next internship. Stay tuned for that&#8230;</em></p>

They plan to do this through an application that tracks goals and an evaluation platform that helps ascertain progress made in meeting these goals.</p>
<p>You can read their press release below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unemployment has become a world wide problem, there are more graduates than job opportunities. Governments are trying to create employment opportunities but it is not that easy. 90% of the unemployed are youths and they can&#8217;t get jobs because they lack experience. We find graduates on the street corners selling airtime or tomatoes for a living. The sad part is even if they are killing it at selling tomatoes they can&#8217;t put it on their CV and add value to it. At the end of the day why can&#8217;t we consider selling tomatoes as a job. EMF App as come up with a solution to make informal experience measurable against formal experience.</p>
<p>We are promoting passion over experience, it is sad that employees have lost passion at work it. We have more clock punchers than passionate people and we expect companies to grow. “EMF is here to bring back passion and make users stand out amongst the rest”, explained Rose Rufaro Makoni the founder of EMF motivators. “Technology is evolving and we should find ways to apply it even to solve unemployment like what we are trying to do, companies should be tired of employing people who are not passionate, we are saying EMF is here to bring out people’s passion so that it will be easier for them to pick the best candidates.”</p>
<p><strong>How it will work</strong>: You download the app on to your phone or tablet. Register an account with EMF and it will take you to goal page so you can start working on what you want to achieve. On the goal page you can set your goal name, you can give a brief summary of your goal. Goal is out of 100 percentage. You enter your start date and end date. You can then save your Goal. On your top left bar there is task icon you can click on it to add task. Tasks is breaking down your goal into smaller components that you can manage. You can add as many tasks as you want and on your task page you can add task name brief description task percentage and completion date.</p>
<p>If you miss a task it will grey out and deduct task percentage from overall goal percentage .EMF will send you a reminder for you to work on tasks before completion date. Goal details page shows all the goals you are working on and if they are completed or not. On this page you have the option to share your results on social media. My progress page will show you the progress you made that month using pie charts, bar chart etc. you can also share your monthly progress on social media as well you will find the share button on the top right corner.</p>
<p>At the completion of your goal you should have Goal name, brief summary of goal, list of passed and failed tasks and overall percentage. You can share your results on social media or have it as word or PDF. EMF will be able to provide solid evidence of users hard work even if you are applying for a job employers will be able to see how well you can work with little resources and no supervision.</p>
<p>“We plan to use artifical intelligence to determine mood and send you a motivational quotes according to your mood in the future”, said Jerry Dengu one of EMF director. “We plan to change the game and encourage youth to follow their dreams. Experience should not dictate our future, we should follow our passion and meet goals we set”.</p>
<p>EMF will also send you motivational quotes to encourage you to work towards goals. It should also help small businesses keep track of the goals they set. It is time as youth that we should create opportunities for each other.</p>
<p>On the 24<sup>th</sup> of March EMF had a soft launch of their prototype which had great response from young adults, students and small business owners. “EMF App is giving us hope as students we worry what will happen to us after school, if EMF can show our hard work and make us stand out we are going to support it. We have great ideas and I think with the help of EMF we are able to share them”, said Nicholas a student at UZ.</p>
<p>We plan to release the App very soon follow us on Facebook “EMF App” for a live release of the app. It will be available on Playstore, Applestore and Windows.</p>

In that respect, competitive edge will be attained by making use of the data to deliver products to relevant customers.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a growing number of businesses are hinging on the use of <a href="https://www.biznessapps.com/blog/geofencing-as-a-marketing-strategy-learn-from-8-businesses-who-are-profiting-from-geofencing/">geofencing to utilize customers location data in providing products and services.</a></p>
<p>Geofencing is a location-based service that makes an app or other software use GPS, Wi-Fi or cellular data to prompt a pre-programmed action as the mobile device enters or exits a virtual boundary. It depends upon mobile apps like messaging applications to make the distribution of targeted messages possible.</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>For companies to utilize geofencing, it must create a virtual boundary (fencing) around a specified location (geo) in GPS. The company could simply draw 100 feet around a location on Google Maps as defined by an App’s settings or technically speaking, Application Programming Interface. This virtual geofence will then prompt a response when an authorized device enters or exits that area, as specified by a company’s developer.</p>
<p>For instance, a customer who has a geofencing app of Chicken Inn goes to Mutare. After landing in Mutare, he or she gets a notification from the app telling him or her about where the nearest Chicken Inn outlet is located and if it has any special offers.</p>
<h4>Why should a Business adopt the Geofencing marketing approach</h4>
<p>By setting up virtual boundaries around a specific location, the marketing part comes when a targeted message is delivered immediately when a potential customer crosses the fenced location.</p>
<p>Despite big companies like <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/65223-eight-more-examples-of-geofencing-you-should-know-about">Uber, Walmart, and Starbucks</a> already using geofencing marketing, the following stats are of interest for deciding to adopt geofencing;</p>

<h4>The benefits of Geofencing marketing?</h4>
<p>Since geofencing personalizes marketing messages according to a recipient’s location, a business can target people in the vicinity of their shop thus increasing the possibility of drawing more people to the outlet.</p>
<p>Through leveraging this technology, once a business implements location-based marketing, it accesses a lot of data which can be harnessed to form insights as to which outlets or shops are performing better relative to others, which target segments are more approachable, which locations are more suitable for expanding business etc.</p>

Kwese said that its bouquet would, as a result, start to offer 100 channels in totality adding on its current 77 channels.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have an amazing line up of new channels on their way. Some of the channels are our own<br />
innovations and they take time to complete, but we are almost there now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, we are disappointed to let you know that Kwese has not lived up to its word as they haven’t introduced the 23 channels. March has passed and April is approaching its end but still nothing has come.</p>
<p>Kwese’s announcement was accompanied by so much enthusiasm such that soccer fanatics had speculated that the new batch of channels would include soccer channels. So this latest failure to deliver on this promise will put a dent in its reputation</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/kwese-channels-still-working/">Last month Kwese mistakenly sent us a press release in which it said it is taking off 6 channels on its current bouquet.</a> They of course clarified the position and did not take down the six channels. However, this was unrelated to the promise of 23 channels that had been made earlier.</p>
<h4>Could it be a delay?</h4>
<blockquote><p>We select each channel very carefully because we don’t want poor quality channels on our platform.<br />
Once a channel is selected it can take up to a year to conclude negotiations with the other party,” said<br />
the spokesman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding this comment, Kwese was probably presumptuous in making this announcement because adding a new channel takes protracted negotiations which can take an unpredictable amount of time.</p>
<p><em>Or Kwese lied to us?</em></p>
<p>We reached out to Kwese and they are yet to comment.</p>

As I was talking to <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/04/zimbopy-mentorship-week-in-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the mentors</a> at the event it became clear that obtaining Raspberry Pi units locally is an exercise in futility. The mentors at the event said they end up resorting to getting relatives/friends from outside the country to bring in units for them.</p>
<p>As you can probably see, this is not really a viable solution to the problem because at the end of the day if you do not have a relative abroad you cannot get your hands on these simple computing devices. It’s almost ridiculous, but I’ll vent about that on another day.</p>
<p>Right now let’s talk about the good news. You may have heard of Netro Electronics. If not, Netro is a company that’s selling the Raspberry Pi units at an affordable price in order to help make the devices easily accessible, be it to students or anyone who has an interest in these type of things.</p>
<h4>Price comparisons</h4>
<p>Obviously compared to buying from outside the price listed for the Raspberry Pi is a bit higher but this was always going to be the case when you factor in duty and markup. However the reason why this is an appealing deal is because you get to buy the units in bond notes, so there’s that. For example, the Raspberry Pi 3B unit is priced at $83 bucks and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s prohibitively expensive or expensive at all.</p>
<p>They also sell other components including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> </strong>5v Motor DC</li>
<li>9v Transformer</li>
<li>Arduino Mini Kit</li>
<li>Arduino Nano</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;and many other things.</p>
<h4>Where are they?</h4>
<p>Ok, so now you may be thinking of dropping by and checking out what they have. If that’s the case Netro Electronics is situated at Jona City on the 12<sup>th</sup> floor. They have another shop in Bulawayo and that’s at .</p>
<p>If you aren’t in the two metropolis’ don’t worry as Netro have agents at universities around the country. They have agents at :</p>
<ul>
<li>CUT (Chinhoyi)</li>
<li>NUST (Bulawayo)</li>
<li>BUSE (Bindura)</li>
<li>MSU (Gweru)</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason they have a presence in universities is because they realised how difficult it was for university students to do their final year projects due to the lack of components.</p>
<p>In Netro’s own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some students lack the knowledge of the existing technology which</p>
<p>they can use to build practical projects. Therefore, access to necessary learning equipment</p>
<p>has been a menacing challenge. As such we are trying to cover the whole country through</p>
<p>online services and delivery to customers’ doorstep. We have also decided not only to</p>
<p>supply components but also to give assistance, thus we introduced tutorials and project</p>
<p>support.</p></blockquote>

<p>When TelOne started billing customers in US dollars back in February 2009, <a href="http://When TelOne started billing customers in US dollars back in February 2009, it was accused of having converted Zimbabwean Dollar bills to US dollars at unrealistic exchange rates resulting in ridiculously high bills which subscribers failed to settle.">it was accused of having converted Zimbabwean Dollar bills to US dollars at unrealistic exchange rates resulting in ridiculously high bills which subscribers failed to settle.</a></p>
<p>Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) has reported that the interest rates charged on Telone debts will fall from 3% to 0.04% and the reprieve will only affect businesses but sidelining households.</p>
<p>ZNCC, Branch Manager Golden Muoni stated that profitability in companies is being lowered because of exorbitant debts they have to clear to utility companies like Zesa and Zinwa and other parastatals. So the clemency offered by Telone will somewhat reduce the cost of doing business for companies.</p>
<blockquote><p>As a business, obviously cost is something which sometimes in this environment affects our businesses. All the businesses they benefited really from that engagement that we did with TelOne,” Muoni said.</p>
<p>So, it’s benefiting because you are reducing the cost of doing business. It helps for you to increase your profitability because cost drives the business to unprofitability. The more your costs are increasing, the lesser you are making a profit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Telone is losing subscribers as more businesses and more individuals are closing their fixed lines so as to avoid paying fixed charges and focus on paying off their debt. Thereby reducing interest rates, Telone is seeking to avoid losing customers who are now migrating to using mobile phones for their day-to-day communications.</p>

<p>The award is hosted by BMCE Bank of Africa. BMCE is the second largest private bank in Morocco with a staggering 690+ banks in Morocco alone whilst they have over 500 banks throughout the rest of Africa. Anyway, the goal of the Africa Entrepreneurship Award (we’ll call it AEA going forward) is to inspire Africans – both in Africa and abroad- to come up with businesses within the African continent, creating jobs that improve lives.</p>
<p>For 2018, the AEA will be offering $1 million for these innovative entrepreneurs. There is a jury that will decide the number of winners and how much is allocated to each winner. If your idea is that cool there is a minor chance you could walk away with the entire prize since the jury decides. Go big or go home!</p>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p>Yes, there’s a million dollars up for grabs, but more importantly, how do you get your slice of the cake? Well here’s a list of the requirements you need to meet and will be judged upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are an African citizen, &amp; over 18 years of age.</li>
<li>Your idea or business is a for-profit.</li>
<li>You have a strategy for positive social impact.</li>
<li>Your idea or business includes a technological component</li>
<li>Your idea or business is for Africa</li>
<li>Your idea fits in one this year’s categories</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Award Categories</strong></h4>
<p>You probably noticed the last point was talking about categories and yet we had not spoken about those. Well, worry not since that is what we are going to talk about now:</p>
<h4><strong>Innovation</strong></h4>
<p>To fit in this category your idea must be a new technology or invention, a new business model or an attempt to solve a problem that has never been solved before in your region.</p>
<p>This includes ideas that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Durable</li>
<li>Multi-functional</li>
<li>Environmentally sustainable</li>
<li>Low cost</li>
<li>And in all sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply for the innovation category click <a href="https://app.africanentrepreneurshipaward.com/en/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Sport</h4>
<p>For this category, your idea must promote integrity, perseverance and friendship to unite communities.</p>
<p>This includes ideas in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apparel, Equipment and Footwear</li>
<li>Fitness, Training and Sports Infrastructure</li>
<li>Events, Media and Spectators Experience</li>
<li>Health and Nutrition</li>
<li>Talent Management</li>
<li>Leisure and Tourism</li>
</ul>
<p>Click <a href="https://app.africanentrepreneurshipaward.com/en/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to apply for this category.</p>
<h4><strong>Deadline</strong></h4>
<p>The deadline for submission of applications is 30 April. Around the corner but there seems to be high stakes so if you are an entrepreneur it might be a good idea to dive in head first and send those applications.</p>
<p>This fund is casting a wider net so it will be interesting to see who the eventual beneficiaries are and if their ideas ever reach regional prominence. Good Luck!</p>

These good hackers are more commonly known as ethical hackers. As with most good guys, ethical hackers rarely make the headlines but they are very important.</p>
<h4>Who is offering the course?</h4>
<p>The courses are being offered on the <a href="https://www.guru99.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guru99 website</a>. Apart from these courses, the site also offers tutorials on other things like Photoshop, Excel, BigData, Digital Marketing and other topics so it might be worth checking and see if they offer anything you are interested in.</p>
<h4>What is Ethical Hacking?</h4>
<p>An ethical hacker is “a skilled professional who understands and knows how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems and uses the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target system(s).”</p>
<p>Ethical hacking is in essence ‘good hacking.’ If I were to give a comparison or analogy I would say ethical hacking is like white magic whilst the more commonly referred to hacking is more akin to black magic.</p>
<p>The difference is that this hacking that we know more commonly is usually carried out with sinister intent whilst ethical hacking is done prevent to prevent the ‘cool’ hackers from getting their job done. For example, an ethical hacker working for a company would try to stop unethical hackers like anonymous. Even though they have their own beliefs and motivations that might seem humanitarian the type of hacking carried out by anonymous is considered to be unethical.</p>
<h4>Course Structure</h4>
<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand. The course is structured in such a way that your knowledge will be built from the basics towards the more advanced stuff. The first topic you will learn is ‘What is Hacking?’ as most would expect. After that you go onto topics such as <em>Top 6 Ethical Hacking Tools, Wireshark Tutorials, Hacking Linux Systems, 10 Most Common Web Security Vulnerabilities </em>etc. The course has over 15 topics and should hopefully help you get a good understanding of how hacking works.</p>
<p>Oh, and you may be asking ‘what level of understanding when I take this course?’ None. As indicated above the topic starts from the basic stuff so even if you have no knowledge you can just dive in head stuff and figure out if you are up to the task or not.</p>
<h4>There&#8217;s no certification&#8230; but that was to be expected</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s no certification. That may put other people off but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a big deal since the course is FREE after all! Any certification would have been a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>This might also be a good tool to use to see if this kind of a career path interests you but you are yet to actually dip your toes. The free course might help you decide if you this stuff actually interests you or if you should look elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you are interested in checking out the hacking tutorial you can do so <a href="https://www.guru99.com/ethical-hacking-tutorials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We haven’t reviewed the courses ourselves but as something that is being offered at no cost at all, I feel I can recommend these courses and if a user is not satisfied with the quality of information they get they can walk away knowing that you did not waste your &#8216;oh-so-precious&#8217; funds.</p>
<p>I might take this course as it is something that interests me and if I find it to be worthwhile we will meet again on this blog and I will share my thoughts about the course and what I have learnt from it…</p>

Anyway, we will say it again: Chakachaya ne Ecocash is back, it has been running since the 8th of this month actually.</p>
<p>Bear with me, I know you didn&#8217;t need me to say because you have already seen notifications that say you have been awarded points. If you haven&#8217;t then it means you haven&#8217;t transacted with Ecocash in 5 days, what on earth (Zimbabwe) have you been using for money?</p>
<p>This is the second edition of this promotion by Ecocash so that must mean it was successful the first time around and I guess it will become part of the Zim landscape every year going forward, at least let&#8217;s hope so.</p>
<p>It will join the OK Grand Challenge and the TM Pick n Pay pots thingy every year maybe&#8230; It&#8217;s funny these promotions are running at the same time more or less. Is it a winter thing?</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>I am relying on Ecocash&#8217;s ability to make noise so I won&#8217;t detail exactly how the promotion runs. The simple description is that you earn points as you transact using Ecocash.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a new twist though this year. They have what they call Point Booster. Once you get to 5 points you can earn 20 more points by registering for Ecosure or paying your monthly Ecosure premium for at least a dollar.</p>
<p>The more points you have, the higher your chances of winning&#8230;</p>
<h3>What could you win and what are your chances?</h3>
<p>The chances of winning are not bad hey, there will be 150 000 instances of winning over three months (promotion ends on July 5th).</p>
<p>Prizes include residential plots (in Zimbabwe we call them stands), cars, cash (real cash, bond or Ecocash? Will ask), Kwese decoders, Ecosure cover, airtime&#8230;</p>
<h3>Now to the goats</h3>
<p>Prizes of course include cows and goats. I had to ask, what&#8217;s up with livestock in these competitions. Ecocash gave me their answer to that question but I am interested to know your answer. Let us know in the comments or on twitter or on Facebook why you think goats are part of the winnings in the Chakachaya ne Ecocash promotion and you may win a goat yourself.</p>
<p>So just so we are clear, by goat I mean a real goat that bleats not a feature phone. Those who don&#8217;t know, feature phones are referred to as goats in Zim; don&#8217;t ask where that came from. So if you don&#8217;t have plans for a goat, make sure you don&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>Back to the challenge: The winner of a goat here on Techzim is whoever gives the most creative answer to the question, &#8220;Why are goats part of the prizes in the Chakachaya ne Ecocash Promotion?&#8221; Get cracking.</p>
<p>You may win other prizes on our social media platforms as well.</p>
<p>Please note as the label up top says, this is a sponsored post so the prize is coming from Ecocash and not Techzim. Also, since Ecocash has entrusted their brand to us here, please behave in the comments there&#8230;</p>

That application has been accepted by ZERA, so I guess Econet will be going ahead with their plan as intended.</p>
<p>The media notice that has been sent (to media houses, of course) by Econet states:</p>
<blockquote><p>               Generation Licence No.  GC0066/2018</p>
<p>Issued by the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority) in terms of Section 4 (1)(e) of the Energy Regulatory Authority Act (Chapter 13:23) as read with Section 42 of the Electricity Act (Chapter 13:19).</p>
<p>The Generation Licence is hereby granted to ECONET WIRELESS (Private) LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as the licence the Licensee) in terms of Section 42 of the Electricity Act to construct own, operate and maintain Econet Willowvale Solar Plant for the purposes of generation and supply of electricity for own consumption but connected to the grid.</p>
<p>Subject to the Electricity Act, Energy Regulatory Act and the conditions of its licence, he Licensee shall generate electricity for own use.</p>
<p>The conduct of the above-named Licensee under this Licence is subject to the conditions as outlined below or later revisions to these conditions as are approved by the Authority, the terms as set out in Section 47 of the Electricity Act and any other amendments to the relevant legislation.</p>
<p>ISSUED at Harare on the 27<sup>th</sup> of March 2018</p></blockquote>
<p>In an earlier article, we wrote about why <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/does-econet-power-plant-make-business-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Econet is going ‘off the grid’</a> (at least metaphorically) and you might want to check that out for more detail.</p>
<h4>What’s the motivation for Econet?</h4>
<p>Data centres are already quite expensive to run as it is so it would be better if Econet would source their own power. ZESA has already seen two applications to increase their tariffs get turned down but who knows if the tariffs will stay the same for long. Econet probably wanted to avoid this worst case scenario if it happens. Even if this doesn’t turn out to be the case Econet will still save some dollars because of this solution, so win-win either way.</p>
<p>With rumours of load shedding gaining speed, Econet’s solar power plant will essentially mean they are not at the mercy of ZESA’s reliability or lack thereof. Whether these rumours are unfounded or not Econet can rest easy knowing they will not be affected by these issues.</p>
<h4>Following in the footsteps of giants</h4>
<p>This is a forward-looking move that follows in the footsteps of global giants such as Apple and Google who have already started using green energy to power their operations. <a href="https://amp.fastcompany.com/40554151/how-apple-got-to-100-renewable-energy-the-right-way?__twitter_impression=true">Apple Park (their new HQ) is powered by renewable energy as well</a> and the company is pushing for their manufacturing partners to start using renewable energy.</p>
<h4>It’s the little things…</h4>
<p>As you can probably tell by now, to me this is a really impressive move and though the impacts will not be felt immediately they will be felt. When 5 or 10 years from now Econet’s profits and revenues are growing (unless of course something drastic happens) people will look in awe and fail to understand how Econet keeps on growing. These are the small but subtle shifts that lead them to this dominant place.</p>
<p>This is a deliberate move that has been in the making for quite some time now. Moves like these are the reason why the competition has basically been left in the dust.</p>
<h4>Speaking of the competition?</h4>
<p>You may be wondering if Telecel and NetOne are making similar moves. Well right now it is not yet particularly clear and if any of the two are in a position to follow in the steps of Econet then I would think NetOne is in a stronger position than Telecel. <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/netone-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They recently appointed a new CEO, Lazarus Muchenje</a>, so some changes might be imminent. Apart from that, there has been no indication of any direct intent on their part to make a move similar to what Econet has done.</p>
<p>Telecel, on the other hand, seem to be dealing with more pressing issues. The leadership issues that have plagued the company for the last few years are alive and kicking again. Most recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/will-telecels-ownership-issues-ever-end/">Mnangagwa’s son in law and Telecel shareholder (with 40%), Gerald Mlotshwa, is involved in an ownership dispute with Zanu-PF veteran James Makamba</a>. Based on these rumours, renewable energy might not be high on Telecel’s agenda at the moment.</p>
<p>Econet&#8217;s rivals may want to follow suit and adopt similar strategy going forward as the cost-saving opportunity presented is too great to ignore. Hopefully, both NetOne and Telecel are considering this at boardroom level and we will hear an announcement of such plans in the coming months.</p>

The move is part of their aim to grow in the continent and here is the statement <a href="https://golix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golix</a> released to the press announcing the development:</p>
<blockquote><p>Golix expands to South Africa</p>
<p>Zimbabwe’s leading cryptocurrencies exchange, Golix, has coordinated a partnership withBlockstarters, South Africa’s crypto/blockchain hub and incubator, in a move that will see the exchange tapping into a new highly economic active market.</p>
<p>The strategic move, is part of Golix’s initiatives to expand its services to the rest of the continent.</p>
<p>The crypto/blockchain hub and incubator cushions startup firms, against challenges that may stifle them to realise their full potential by providing a conducive environment which comprises of relevant blockchain fields and potential capital ventures.</p>
<p>Entering a new market can be a challenge, hence the incubator hub will offer Golix a chance to smoothly integrate into the South African cryptocurrencies space and meet with like minded startups.</p>
<p>Golix previously had only two offices in Zimbabwe’s capital, which so far house 22 staff members as the exchange continues to grows.</p>
<p>Golix’s Product Manager, Yeukai Kusangaya, said this was a welcome development.</p>
<p>“This is a positive and a promising move. The crypto/blockchain hub and incubator is set to be a huge learning platform for Golix in an all new different environment. During this period the hub will be more of a compass to us as navigate into a new market factoring in the cost of exploring new depths like this. Also believe that South Africa is the best place because of its vibrant economy which, like Zimbabwe, has also interest in cryptocurrencies,” she said.</p>
<p>Blockstarters co-founder Kreaan Singh said “As entrepreneurs ourselves, we created Blockstarters to bring together the very best in the crypto &amp; blockchain industry. We want startups to grow together, and to inspire one another to create innovative solutions for Africa. How better to do this than to bring everyone under one roof? We the Blockstarters founders have been involved in the industry since 2013, and now live much of our lifestyles off cryptocurrencies. Companies like Golix will one day help millions of other people to do the same.”</p>
<p>Currently they are more than 3 million Zimbabweans estimated to be based in South Africa. Annual they remit millions back home. Considering that, as of the moment, Golix does not support the Rand (ZAR), being part of the hub is likely to see the exchange introducing the currency.</p>
<p>Unlike the Zimbabwean government’s cautious stance towards cryptocurrencies, South Africa has adopted a more proactive approach. Early February 2018 it was reported that the Central Bank of South Africa had said that it would carry out its own research into the feasibility of blockchain technology in South Africa. Such a move can prove progressive to cryptocurrencies exchange and boost public confidence.</p>

This is a welcome feature but it does come with a few caveats.</p>
<h4>What’s changed?</h4>
<p>Well, the Whatsapp servers would only keep media for a maximum of 30 days and after that users could no longer download media files. If you noticed, this is why if someone sent you a media file and you later deleted it, re-downloading after a certain period would not work. This is because once the files were no longer on Whatsapp servers the media was gone for good.</p>
<p>Going forward, users will be able to delete media files but still come back to download them if they realise it was an important file, a slight irritation I’ve had to deal with a couple of times.</p>
<p>The re-download (not the official name) feature will only be available for files from chats that have not been deleted by both users, so this will not be a perfect solution because this means if you want to re-download a photo you will only be able to do so if the sender of that file still has that chat. I guess half a loaf is better than nothing.</p>
<h4>Only for beta testers right now</h4>
<p>The update is already available for beta testers since they get to preview features much earlier than the rest of the ‘normal’ users. If you are a beta tester and you update your Whatsapp to version 2.8.113 then you will be one of the few that have this feature.</p>
<p>If you are not a beta tester, you can rest easy knowing that the feature will be coming to users pretty soon anyway since these features are rolled out to users after the testing period.</p>
<h4>Effects of the update will be felt later&#8230;</h4>
<p>In terms of usefulness, the effects of this update won’t be felt immediately. Because Whatsapp has updated their servers now, it means right now you probably will not be able to download media files which were sent 6 months ago, since those were probably deleted a long time ago. The updated is more of a ‘going forward’ solution than an immediate term thing. I’m sure users will welcome the feature with open arms either way since it addresses an annoyance that irritated a lot of people.</p>
<p>It seems the update is only available to Android users for now. This means it will probably be coming to iOS users once it is out of beta testing and is officially available to all users.</p>

Here&#8217;s how you can avoid the problem if you haven&#8217;t been caught in the crossfire and if you have here&#8217;s how to cleanse yourself of this cancer.</p>
<h4>How It Happens…</h4>
<p>You get a message from your “infected” friend telling you to open their video. Once you click the link it redirects you to a YouTube-like site. A closer look at the URL shows that this site is not really YouTube but in actuality is something called <strong><em>yabio.filmnag</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The video you had been led to believe is your friends refuses to play and you get an error which prompts you to download an extension. The error says, “You must install the codec extension to watch the video!” and it instantly prompts you to download an extension.</p>
<p>Firstly, YouTube does not need any extensions for you to play any videos on the site. Secondly, downloading these kinds of links is how people end up getting phished. So if you have installed this extension you may want to uninstall it as early as possible.</p>
<p>The kind of risks that are posed by installing this kind of an extension can have deeply profound and debilitating effects on users. Once the extension has been installed, in essence, you have given the extension permission to access a lot of stuff in your chrome browser. It can track your activity on the internet and thus gain access to vital information such as credit card data or account data.</p>
<p>This access also allows the extension to then send messages to your Facebook friends and the chain goes on and on and on&#8230;and on. Some extensions can also change your search engine and remove your bookmarks. Basically, once your browser has been hijacked the experience is so terrible you might end up having to remove the browser entirely…</p>
<h4>If you are already having trouble…</h4>
<p>This one is a bit complicated. Once browser hijacking extensions have installed themselves removing them is not as easy as removing other extensions. The extensions usually try their best to make themselves irremovable. This means a simple uninstall from the extensions options menu or chrome’s extension manager may be futile. For this particular extension, we didn’t have much trouble removing it and though we got an error message the extension was no more.</p>
<p>In another case a while ago when my browser was hijacked by a different, more stubborn extension I ended up uninstalling Chrome and reinstalling it a few weeks later since I was not a fan of  Firefox or the Opera browser. Anyway, stay safe and never install any extension unless you are sure that the extension is actually safe.</p>

Gross revenue collections were 8.1% above the target of US $1.029 billion.<a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/01/zimra-continues-to-lose-millions-of-dollars-due-to-the-online-system-failure/"> Zimra attributes the improved revenue collection to enhanced effective use of automation.</a><br />
The country’s tax collector is optimizing the use of it its e-services platform (Asycuda – Automated System for Customs Data) and fiscal devices to increase revenue collection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/03/zimra-system-in-beitbridge-goes-down-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Despite Asycuda’s persistent breakdowns, Zimra is continuously surpassing its targets. This year already Asycuda has gone down twice for several days. Imagine if it didn’t experience these breakdowns by how much would they have surpassed their target.</a></p>
<h4>Q1 2018 Revenue Contributions</h4>
<p>Corporate Income tax revenue surged to US$128.55million from US$98million.The positive performance is ascribed to increased electronic and mobile financial transactions.</p>
<p>VAT on Local sales revenue improved by US$30.8million to $US265.70 because of increased use of plastic money and Tax Management system which improved compliance.</p>
<p>Vat on Imports collections hit US$ 123.14million against a target of US$100.60million registering a US$43.95 increase compared to 2017 first quarter.</p>
<p>Customs Duty collections for the quarter increased to US$90.41 against the US$88.78 target. Asycuda was cited as a catalyst in curtailing leakages at the border.</p>
<p>Excise Duty revenue had a positive variance of 17.65% as it grew to US$233.32 million. The success of the Electronic Cargo Tracking System was given credit for propelling this increase.</p>
<p>Withholding Tax on Contracts surpassed the target of US$35.84million against a target of US$44.76million.<br />
Carbon Tax collections registered a 45.17% growth from US$10.66million to US$8.83million attributed to increased importation of fuel.<br />
Mining Royalties revenue decreased to US$19.5million against a target of US$21.50million. This was attributed to fluctuating global prices of minerals.</p>
<p>Dividends, Fees, interest&amp; Remittances grew by 32.69% to US$18.72million against a set target of US$14. 11million.Other taxes reached US$17.57million falling short of the targeted US$20.53million.</p>
<p>A large amount of revenue increase stemmed from the continuous embracing of technology at Zimra. However, the current success can be improved on if Asycuda’s persistent collapses are fixed.</p>
<p>Shortage of fiscal devices is also undermining Zimra’s revenue collection capabilities. The revenue authority reported that the “current fiscalisation has been completed but many people do not have gadgets and those with them are complaining of high costs of fiscal gadgets and their maintenance”</p>

In line with this event, ZITF has made an app that will help people attending the event navigate their way around the stands and also know when which sessions will be held.</p>
<p>The load times are frustratingly slow but once the loading screens are out of your way and you are ready to roll the app proves itself to be a must-have if you are attending the ZITF. Here are some cool features that will come with the app.</p>
<h4><strong>Upcoming</strong> sessions</h4>
<p>The app has an ‘Upcoming Sessions’ menu. This menu contains a programme of sorts and has speeches and events that will be taking place during the trade fair. Some examples of these events include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome Remarks</li>
<li>Key Note Address and Official Opening</li>
<li>Innovative Solutions To Liquidity Challenges</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the addresses that will be held and once you are using the app you can add the sessions that interest you to your schedule and keep track of those.</p>

<h4>Exhibitors…</h4>
<p>The app has a list of all the exhibitors or at least what appears to be all the exhibitors. The exhibitors are listed alphabetically and they it seems they are over 100 exhibitors listed (which is why I think that’s all of them). Anyway, if you click on any of the exhibitors you’ll be presented with details such as the name of the stand where the exhibitor will be at the fair. There are also contact details, website links and an employee you can contact.</p>
<p>Lastly, users can also add exhibitors of interest and these will be grouped on their own under a ‘My Exhibitors’ menu. Based on the exhibitors you add to this list, the app can also suggest similar exhibitors and what this means is if you are going to ZITF and looking to cover a specific type of exhibitors then this app will help you discover exhibitors of this vein who you may have not actually heard of or just accidentally skipped since the list is so lengthy.</p>

<h4><strong>Attendees</strong></h4>
<p>The app also has a list of attendees and you can get their contact details and reach out to them in order to facilitate easier networking once the event has commenced.</p>
<h4><strong>Essential</strong></h4>
<p>Overall, the app is very useful and will help users. It will only be useful for a single week but if you are going to the event this is a must-have app if navigating the floors and finding your way around stands as easily as possible is important to you!</p>

<p>With Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg under pressure by the US Congress and greater regulation on data privacy looking ever more likely, swirling revelations about the way in which social media have been used have put the spotlight on the wide implications of the fast-emerging, data-driven digital economy. There is no time to waste in ensuring that this technological revolution brings about more inclusive development as opposed to wider divides.</p>
<p>The digital economy is evolving fast. For example, between 2012 and 2017,<span> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of monthly Facebook users surged from 1 billion to 2.2 billion</a>. The fastest growth is seen in developing countries. Indeed, some 90 percent of all new Internet users over the past half-decade or so live in developing countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, digital divides remain massive. According to the International Telecommunication Union,<span> </span><a href="https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/2017-PR60.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only half of the world’s population use the Internet</a>, and in the least developed countries that proportion is just one in six.</p>
<p>Usage patterns also vary. For example, while most Internet users in developing countries are generally quick to embrace social networks, like Facebook, far fewer use the Internet to make payments or buy goods or services. This often reflects a lack of trust in the Internet or limited knowledge of how to leverage this technology.</p>
<p>Although the UN General Assembly in 2015 committed to harnessing information and communications technologies in support of the newly-minted<span> </span><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, I am concerned that too little is done to this end, and too slowly. In particular,<span> </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-ecommerce/facebook-privacy-debate-is-tip-of-the-e-commerce-iceberg-u-n-says-idUSKBN1H42AE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more action is needed<span> </span></a>at both national and international levels to adapt and adopt policies to prepare for the digital revolution, of which we have only seen the beginning.</p>
<p>Take the case of social media. In the past few weeks much attention has been given to the way in which users’ data have been analyzed and monetized by the companies controlling the digital platforms that underpin social networks. Other digital platforms similarly collect massive amounts of data that are analyzed and monetized by selling advertising.</p>
<p>Data privacy sits at the core of the debate. Countries differ greatly in the approach taken to protect the users of various Internet services. In the European Union, a new<span> </span><a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation<span> </span></a>will go into effect on 25 May 2018. It will require businesses to protect the personal data of any European Union citizen they do business with, including employees, suppliers and customers. This will have significant implications for doing business in an increasingly data-driven economy.</p>
<p>Data privacy will become a growing concern also in developing countries, where the use of digital platforms is expanding fast. However, as documented by my organization, the<span> </span><a href="http://unctad.org/en/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Conference on Trade and Development<span> </span></a>(UNCTAD), almost 60 developing countries currently do not have any data protection legislation in place. Improving this situation is urgently needed, not only to protect the 418 million Facebook users in these countries, but also to ensure that enterprises in these countries are able to trade effectively with partners, such as the European Union, which are imposing stringent requirements in this area.</p>
<p>And the lack of data protection is only one example of how many countries are ill-prepared for the digital economy. In order to be able to engage in and benefit from electronic commerce, for instance, urgent action is similarly needed in areas such as digital infrastructure, payment solutions, trade logistics, skills development, consumer protection and financing of digital entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Addressing current deficiencies is essential and the time to act is now. Governments need to assign higher priority to the digital dimension of their development strategies. This means, for example, understanding how digitalization will affect economic growth, jobs, trade and innovation. Equally important is to examine its impact on competition and taxation as well as on environment, education, health and governance.</p>
<p>This is no easy task.<span> </span><a href="http://www.oecd.org/">OECD<span> </span></a>economies have since last year been engaged in a cross-cutting, comprehensive project entitled<span> </span><a href="http://www.oecd.org/going-digital/">Going Digital</a>, involving 14 intergovernmental committees. While there is an even greater need for non-OECD countries to address the same issues in a systematic way, they lack appropriate fora for advancing the dialogue at the global level.</p>
<p>In UNCTAD, a new<span> </span><a href="http://unctad.org/en/Pages/Meetings/Group-of-Experts-Ecommerce-Digital-Economy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intergovernmental Group of Experts on E-Commerce and the Digital Economy<span> </span></a>will be meeting for the second time during our<span> </span><a href="http://unctad.org/en/conferences/e-week2018/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-Commerce Week<span> </span></a>in Geneva, held from 16-20 April. The aim is to examine the implications of digital platforms for trade and development. E-Commerce Week will gather about 1,000 participants representing governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations from some 100 countries. This is a valuable opportunity but far from sufficient given the broad-based effects expected from digitalization.</p>
<p>International dialogue also has to be complemented by greatly increased aid efforts. In this context, I urge all donor agencies to ratchet up their support in areas that can help developing countries to better prepare for the evolving digital economy. In view of the significant and rapid transformations expected, current efforts are far from adequate.</p>
<p>UNCTAD’s<span> </span><a href="https://etradeforall.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eTrade for All<span> </span></a>initiative, which now gathers 29 international and regional organizations, aims to make support to developing countries wishing to benefit more from e-commerce more effective and transparent. But for it to have the desired impact, it will need to go hand in hand with much increased financial support by the international community, including from bilateral donors, development banks and private sector foundations. Many countries need help, and they need it now – not in five or ten years.</p>
<p>We must avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. This time, we should make every effort to ensure that the digital revolution brings about inclusive development rather than more inequality.</p>
